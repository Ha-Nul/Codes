 The effective Hamiltonian describing cross-Kerr interaction between modes a and b can be given as:
 $$ \hat{H_{kerr}}=\hbar\chi^(3)\hat{n_a}\hat{n_b} $$
 where $\chi^(3) $ is the (rescaled) third-order susceptibility of the nonlinear medium,
 and $\hat{n_a}=\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}$ and $\hat{n}_b=\hat{b}^{\dagger}\hat{b}$ are the photon number operators
 given in terms of the annihilation ($\hat{a}$ and $\hat{b}$)and creation($\hat{a}^{\dagger}$ and $\hat{b}^{\dagger}$)operators.

 We analyze photon-number qubits as superpositions of vacuum and single-photon Fock states.
 Using an appropriately strong cross-Kerr interaction,
 \\ it is possible to perform the CPHASE gate on two qubits
 so that the states $\ket{00},\ket{01},$ and $\ket{10}$ are unchanged,
 
 but the two single-photon states gain some additional phase, $\delta$.(i.e., $\ket{11}$ $\rightarrow$ $e^{i\delta}\ket{11}$).
 In particular, for $\delta=\pi$, the CPHASE gate becomes the controlled-sign (CSIGN) gate,
 which is equivalent up to a unitary transformation, to the controlled-NOT gate.
