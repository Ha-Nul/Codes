Chapters address random walks, equilibrium systems, entropy, free energies, quantum systems, calculation and computation, order parameters and topological defects, correlations and linear response theory, and abrupt and continuous phase transitions. Exercises explore the enormous range of phenomena where statistical mechanics provides essential insight — from card shuffling to how cells avoid errors when copying DNA, from the arrow of time to animal flocking behavior, from the onset of chaos to fingerprints. The text is aimed at graduates, undergraduates, and researchers in mathematics, computer science, engineering, biology, and the social sciences as well as to physicists, chemists, and astrophysicists. As such, it focuses on those issues common to all of these fields, background in quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and advanced physics should not be needed, although scientific sophistication and interest will be important.}",

Emphasizing understanding and clarity rather than technical manipulation, these lectures de-mystify the subject and show precisely “how things work.” Goldenfeld keeps in mind a reader who wants to understand why things are done, what the results are, and what in principle can go wrong. The book reaches both experimentalists and theorists, students and even active researchers, and assumes only a prior knowledge of statistical mechanics at the introductory graduate level.Advanced, never-before-printed topics on the applications of renormalization group far from equilibrium and to partial differential equations add to the uniqueness of this book.",

title = {Quantum phase transitions in two-dimensional superconductors: a review on recent experimental progress},
journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {Superconductor–insulator/metal transition (SMT) as a paradigm of quantum phase transition has been a research highlight over the last three decades. Benefit from recent developments in the fabrication and measurements of two-dimensional (2D) superconducting films and nanodevices, unprecedented quantum phenomena have been revealed in the quantum phase transitions of 2D superconductors. In this review, we introduce the recent progress on quantum phase transitions in 2D superconductors, focusing on the quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) and anomalous metal state. Characterized by a divergent critical exponent when approaching zero temperature, QGS of SMT is discovered in ultrathin crystalline Ga films and subsequently detected in various 2D superconductors. The universality of QGS indicates the profound influence of quenched disorder on quantum phase transitions. Besides, in a 2D superconducting system, whether a metallic ground state can exist is a long-sought mystery. Early experimental studies indicate an intermediate metallic state in the quantum phase transition of 2D superconductors. Recently, in high-temperature superconducting films with patterned nanopores, a robust anomalous metal state (i.e. quantum metal or Bose metal) has been detected, featured as the saturated resistance in the low temperature regime. Moreover, the charge-2e quantum oscillations are observed in nanopatterned films, indicating the bosonic nature of the anomalous metal state and ending the debate on whether bosons can exist as a metal. The evidences of the anomalous metal states have also been reported in crystalline epitaxial thin films and exfoliated nanoflakes, as well as granular composite films. High quality filters are used in these works to exclude the influence of external high frequency noises in ultralow temperature measurements. The observations of QGS and metallic ground states in 2D superconductors not only reveal the prominent role of quantum fluctuations and dissipations but also provide new perspective to explore quantum phase transitions in superconducting systems.}
