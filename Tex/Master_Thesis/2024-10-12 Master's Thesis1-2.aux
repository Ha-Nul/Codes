\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {16}{\ignorespaces Considering the case of K=3, where the total indices to be calculated are $[0, 1, 2]$ in the code, K matches the number of grids in $\tau $ grid, the total possible calculation order is as shown on the right. For example, in the first line, the calculation proceeds in the order of $\mathcal  {G}[2]\hat  {N}\mathcal  {G}[0]\lambda _1\mathcal  {G}[0]\hat  {N}\mathcal  {G}[0]\lambda _1$. When examining the listed order on the right, we can see that the order of repeated numbers is listed, which is the same as the number of cases where two numbers are selected and arranged from $[0, 1, 2]$. Here, we can see that the total number of calculation cases can be represented by selecting and arranging two numbers from the three numbers 2, 1, and 0. To achieve this, we can introduce the following matrix: }}{36}{}\protected@file@percent }
