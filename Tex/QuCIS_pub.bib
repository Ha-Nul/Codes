	abstract = {<p>The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements\&rsquo; sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup\&rsquo;s sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.</p>},

	month = {6/3/2024},
	abstract = {<p>Simulating fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom, relevant for a range of quantum field theories, represents a promising application for quantum simulators. Mapping fermions to qubits is challenging in 2+1 and higher spacetime dimensions, and mapping bosons demands substantial quantum-computational overhead. These features complicate the realization of mixed fermion-boson quantum systems in digital quantum computers. We propose a native fermion-(large-)spin analog quantum simulator by utilizing dopant arrays in silicon. Specifically, we show how to use a dynamical lattice of coupled nuclear spins and conduction-band electrons to realize a quantum field theory: an extended Jackiw-Rebbi model involving coupled fermions and quantum rotors. We demonstrate the feasibility of observing dynamical mass generation and a confinement-deconfinement quantum phase transition in 1+1 dimensions on this platform, even in the presence of strong long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, we employ finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov simulations to investigate the dynamics of mass generation in two-dimensional square and honeycomb arrays, showing that this phenomenon can be simulated with realistic experimental parameters. Our findings reveal two distinct phases, and demonstrate robustness against the addition of Coulomb interactions. Finally, we discuss experimental signatures of the phases through transport and local charge sensing in dopant arrays. This study lays the foundation for quantum simulations of quantum field theories exhibiting fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom using donors in silicon.</p>},

	month = {3/27/2024},
	abstract = {<p>Recently, many experiments have been conducted with the goal of demonstrating a quantum advantage over classical computation. One popular framework for these experiments is Gaussian Boson Sampling, where quadratic photonic input states are interfered via a linear optical unitary and subsequently measured in the Fock basis. In this work, we study the modal entanglement of the output states in this framework just before the measurement stage. Specifically, we compute Page curves as measured by various R{\'e}nyi-α entropies, where the Page curve describes the entanglement between two partitioned groups of output modes averaged over all linear optical unitaries. We derive these formulas for α=1 (i.e. the von Neumann entropy), and, more generally, for all positive integer α, in the asymptotic limit of infinite number of modes and for input states that are composed of single-mode-squeezed-vacuum state with equal squeezing strength. We then analyze the limiting behaviors when the squeezing is small and large. Having determined the averages, we then explicitly calculate the R{\'e}nyi-α variance for integers α\&gt;1, and we are able to show that these entropies are weakly typical.</p>},

In Bell sampling, we measure two copies of a state prepared by a quantum circuit in the transversal Bell basis. We show that the Bell samples are classically intractable to produce and at the same time constitute what we call a circuit shadow: from the Bell samples we can efficiently extract information about the quantum circuit preparing the state, as well as diagnose circuit errors. In addition to known properties that can be efficiently extracted from Bell samples, we give several new and efficient protocols: an estimator of state fidelity, a test for the depth of the circuit and an algorithm to estimate a lower bound to the number of T gates in the circuit. With some additional measurements, our algorithm learns a full description of states prepared by circuits with low T-count.</p>},

To explain the observed behavior, we introduce the effective distance d\&prime;, which reduces to the standard distance for unbiased noise. To study CDSC performance in the thermodynamic limit, we focus on random CDSCs. Using the statistical mechanical mapping for quantum codes, we uncover a phase diagram that describes random CDSC families with 50\% threshold at infinite bias. In the high-threshold region, we further demonstrate that typical code realizations outperform the thresholds and subthreshold logical error rates, at finite bias, of the best-known translationally invariant codes. We demonstrate the practical relevance of these random CDSC families by constructing a translation-invariant CDSC belonging to a high-performance random CDSC family.

To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that, for a code encoding k logical qubits in n physical qubits, if the subsystem variance is below an O(k/n) threshold, then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial \&quot;phases\&quot; of codes. Based on our results, we propose O(k/n) as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding quantum complexity and order in many-body quantum systems, generating new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics.

	abstract = {<p>Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of realizing a quantum process, such as preparing a state or implementing a unitary. We present an approach to quantifying the thermodynamic resources required to implement a process if the process\&$\#$39;s complexity is restricted. We focus on the prototypical task of information erasure, or Landauer erasure, wherein an n-qubit memory is reset to the all-zero state. We show that the minimum thermodynamic work required to reset an arbitrary state, via a complexity-constrained process, is quantified by the state\&$\#$39;s complexity entropy. The complexity entropy therefore quantifies a trade-off between the work cost and complexity cost of resetting a state. If the qubits have a nontrivial (but product) Hamiltonian, the optimal work cost is determined by the complexity relative entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the amount of randomness a system appears to have to a computationally limited observer. Similarly, the complexity relative entropy quantifies such an observer\&$\#$39;s ability to distinguish two states. We prove elementary properties of the complexity (relative) entropy and determine the complexity entropy\&$\#$39;s behavior under random circuits. Also, we identify information-theoretic applications of the complexity entropy. The complexity entropy quantifies the resources required for data compression if the compression algorithm must use a restricted number of gates. We further introduce a complexity conditional entropy, which arises naturally in a complexity-constrained variant of information-theoretic decoupling. Assuming that this entropy obeys a conjectured chain rule, we show that the entropy bounds the number of qubits that one can decouple from a reference system, as judged by a computationally bounded referee. Overall, our framework extends the resource-theoretic approach to thermodynamics to integrate a notion of time, as quantified by complexity.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Bell non-locality is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics whereby measurements performed on \&quot;spatially separated\&quot; quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be understood as revealing predetermined values. This is a special case of the more general phenomenon of \&quot;quantum contextuality\&quot;, which says that such correlations can occur even when the measurements are not necessarily on separate quantum systems, but are merely \&quot;compatible\&quot; (i.e. commuting). Crucially, while any non-local game yields an experiment that demonstrates quantum advantage by leveraging the \&quot;spatial separation\&quot; of two or more devices (and in fact several such demonstrations have been conducted successfully in recent years), the same is not true for quantum contextuality: finding the contextuality analogue of such an experiment is arguably one of the central open questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;In this work, we show that an arbitrary contextuality game can be compiled into an operational \&quot;test of contextuality\&quot; involving a single quantum device, by only making the assumption that the device is computationally bounded.

In our VQE experiment, we use LiH and BeH2 as test cases to show that CAFQA achieves faster convergence and obtains lower energy values within the specified computational budget limits. To ensure the seamless execution of VQE on this academic device, we develop a novel hardware-software interface framework that supports independent software environments for both the circuit and hardware end. This mechanism facilitates the automation of VQE-type job executions as well as mitigates the impact of random hardware interruptions.

	abstract = {<p>Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</p>},

Our algorithms generate a decomposition of the evolution operator into a product of simple unitaries that are directly implementable on a quantum computer. Although the theoretical scaling is suboptimal compared with state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., quantum signal processing), the performance of the algorithms we propose is highly competitive in practice. We illustrate this via extensive numerical simulations for several models. For instance, in the strong-field regime of the 1D transverse-field Ising model, our algorithms achieve an improvement of one order of magnitude in both the system size and evolution time that can be simulated with a fixed budget of 1000 arbitrary 2-qubit gates, compared with standard Trotter formulas.</p>},

This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.</p>},

	month = {1/18/2024},
	abstract = {<p>We upper- and lower-bound the optimal precision with which one can estimate an unknown Hamiltonian parameter via measurements of Gibbs thermal states with a known temperature. The bounds depend on the uncertainty in the Hamiltonian term that contains the parameter and on the term\&$\#$39;s degree of noncommutativity with the full Hamiltonian: higher uncertainty and commuting operators lead to better precision. We apply the bounds to show that there exist entangled thermal states such that the parameter can be estimated with an error that decreases faster than 1/n\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;, beating the standard quantum limit. This result governs Hamiltonians where an unknown scalar parameter (e.g. a component of a magnetic field) is coupled locally and identically to n qubit sensors. In the high-temperature regime, our bounds allow for pinpointing the optimal estimation error, up to a constant prefactor. Our bounds generalize to joint estimations of multiple parameters. In this setting, we recover the high-temperature sample scaling derived previously via techniques based on quantum state discrimination and coding theory. In an application, we show that noncommuting conserved quantities hinder the estimation of chemical potentials.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>In the wake of recent progress on quantum computing hardware, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is standardizing cryptographic protocols that are resistant to attacks by quantum adversaries. The primary digital signature scheme that NIST has chosen is CRYSTALS-Dilithium. The hardness of this scheme is based on the hardness of three computational problems: Module Learning with Errors (MLWE), Module Short Integer Solution (MSIS), and SelfTargetMSIS. MLWE and MSIS have been well-studied and are widely believed to be secure. However, SelfTargetMSIS is novel and, though classically as hard as MSIS, its quantum hardness is unclear. In this paper, we provide the first proof of the hardness of SelfTargetMSIS via a reduction from MLWE in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM). Our proof uses recently developed techniques in quantum reprogramming and rewinding. A central part of our approach is a proof that a certain hash function, derived from the MSIS problem, is collapsing. From this approach, we deduce a new security proof for Dilithium under appropriate parameter settings. Compared to the previous work by Kiltz, Lyubashevsky, and Schaffner (EUROCRYPT 2018) that gave the only other rigorous security proof for a variant of Dilithium, our proof has the advantage of being applicable under the condition q = 1 mod 2n, where q denotes the modulus and n the dimension of the underlying algebraic ring. This condition is part of the original Dilithium proposal and is crucial for the efficient implementation of the scheme. We provide new secure parameter sets for Dilithium under the condition q = 1 mod 2n, finding that our public key size and signature size are about 2.9 times and 1.3 times larger, respectively, than those proposed by Kiltz et al. at the same security level.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Many promising quantum applications depend on the efficient quantum simulation of an exponentially large sparse Hamiltonian, a task known as sparse Hamiltonian simulation, which is fundamentally important in quantum computation. Although several theoretically appealing quantum algorithms have been proposed for this task, they typically require a black-box query model of the sparse Hamiltonian, rendering them impractical for near-term implementation on quantum devices.<br />In this paper, we propose a technique named Hamiltonian embedding. This technique simulates a desired sparse Hamiltonian by embedding it into the evolution of a larger and more structured quantum system, allowing for more efficient simulation through hardware-efficient operations. We conduct a systematic study of this new technique and demonstrate significant savings in computational resources for implementing prominent quantum applications. As a result, we can now experimentally realize quantum walks on complicated graphs (e.g., binary trees, glued-tree graphs), quantum spatial search, and the simulation of real-space Schr{\"o}dinger equations on current trapped-ion and neutral-atom platforms. Given the fundamental role of Hamiltonian evolution in the design of quantum algorithms, our technique markedly expands the horizon of implementable quantum advantages in the NISQ era.</p>},

Such systems are capable of spreading entanglement superballistically and achieving an asymptotic speed-up over locally interacting systems. Recently, protocols developed by Eldredge et al. [Phys.

However, the implementation of these protocols in physical systems with long-range interactions remains to be fully realized. In this work, we provide an experimental roadmap towards realizing fast state-transfer protocols in three classes of atomic and molecular systems with dipolar interactions: polar molecules composed of alkali-metal dimers, neutral atoms in excited Rydberg states, and atoms with strong magnetic moments (e.g. dysprosium). As a guide to near-term experimental implementation, we numerically evaluate the tradeoffs between the two protocols for small system sizes and develop methods to address potential crosstalk errors that may arise during the execution of the protocols.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>In this work, we propose a new form of exponential quantum advantage in the context of sensing correlated noise. Specifically, we focus on the problem of estimating parameters associated with Lindblad dephasing dynamics, and show that entanglement can lead to an exponential enhancement in the sensitivity (as quantified via quantum Fisher information of the sensor state) for estimating a small parameter characterizing the deviation of system Lindbladians from a class of maximally correlated dephasing dynamics. This result stands in stark contrast with previously studied scenarios of sensing uncorrelated dephasing noise, where one can prove that entanglement does not lead to an advantage in the signal-to-noise ratio. Our work thus opens a novel pathway towards achieving entanglement-based sensing advantage, which may find applications in characterizing decoherence dynamics of near-term quantum devices. Further, our approach provides a potential quantum-enhanced probe of many-body correlated phases by measuring noise generated by a sensing target.

This work provides an improved, rigorous analysis of these techniques for the task of calculating time-evolved expectation values. We demonstrate that, to achieve error ϵ in a simulation of time T using a pth-order product formula with extrapolation, circuits depths of O(T1+1/ppolylog(1/ϵ)) are sufficient -- an exponential improvement in the precision over product formulae alone. Furthermore, we achieve commutator scaling, improve the complexity with T, and do not require fractional implementations of Trotter steps.

	abstract = {<p>A general quantum circuit can be simulated classically in exponential time. If it has a planar layout, then a tensor-network contraction algorithm due to Markov and Shi has a runtime exponential in the square root of its size, or more generally exponential in the treewidth of the underlying graph. Separately, Gottesman and Knill showed that if all gates are restricted to be Clifford, then there is a polynomial time simulation. We combine these two ideas and show that treewidth and planarity can be exploited to improve Clifford circuit simulation. Our main result is a classical algorithm with runtime scaling asymptotically as nω/2\&lt;n1.19 which samples from the output distribution obtained by measuring all n qubits of a planar graph state in given Pauli bases. Here ω is the matrix multiplication exponent. We also provide a classical algorithm with the same asymptotic runtime which samples from the output distribution of any constant-depth Clifford circuit in a planar geometry. Our work improves known classical algorithms with cubic runtime. A key ingredient is a mapping which, given a tree decomposition of some graph G, produces a Clifford circuit with a structure that mirrors the tree decomposition and which emulates measurement of the corresponding graph state. We provide a classical simulation of this circuit with the runtime stated above for planar graphs and otherwise ntω\&minus;1 where t is the width of the tree decomposition. Our algorithm incorporates two subroutines which may be of independent interest. The first is a matrix-multiplication-time version of the Gottesman-Knill simulation of multi-qubit measurement on stabilizer states. The second is a new classical algorithm for solving symmetric linear systems over F2 in a planar geometry, extending previous works which only applied to non-singular linear systems in the analogous setting.</p>},

However, increasing the evolution time reduces the bandwidth that can be sampled, whereas decreasing the evolution time worsens the sensitivity. In this paper, we attempt to address this by proposing a setup for high-bandwidth applications, with improved overall sensitivity. This is realized by accelerating and holding the atoms using optical dipole traps. We find that accelerations of up to 103\&ndash;105 m/s2 can be achieved using acousto-optic deflectors to move the traps. By comparing the sensitivity of our approach to acceleration as a baseline to traditional atom interferometry, we find a substantial improvement to the state of the art. In the limit of appropriate beam and optics stabilization, sensitivities approaching 10\&minus;14 (m/s2)/\&radic;Hz may be achievable at 1 Hz, while detection at 1 kHz with a sensitivity an order of magnitude better than traditional free-fall atom interferometers is possible with today\&$\#$39;s systems.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Designing efficient and noise-tolerant quantum computation protocols generally begins with an understanding of quantum error-correcting codes and their native logical operations. The simplest class of native operations are transversal gates, which are naturally fault-tolerant. In this paper, we aim to characterize the transversal gates of quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes by exploiting the well-studied properties of their classical counterparts. We start our work by establishing a new geometric characterization of quantum RM codes via the Boolean hypercube and its associated subcube complex. More specifically, a set of stabilizer generators for a quantum RM code can be described via transversal X and Z operators acting on subcubes of particular dimensions. This characterization leads us to define subcube operators composed of single-qubit π/2k Z-rotations that act on subcubes of given dimensions. We first characterize the action of subcube operators on the code space: depending on the dimension of the subcube, these operators either (1) act as a logical identity on the code space, (2) implement non-trivial logic, or (3) rotate a state away from the code space. Second, and more remarkably, we uncover that the logic implemented by these operators corresponds to circuits of multi-controlled-Z gates that have an explicit and simple combinatorial description. Overall, this suite of results yields a comprehensive understanding of a class of natural transversal operators for quantum RM codes.</p>},

We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements. Beyond these hardness results, we present a lower bound on the temperatures that Gibbs states become easy to sample from classically in terms of the maximum degree of the Hamiltonian\&$\#$39;s interaction graph.</p>},

Error tolerance is a persistent challenge for implementing such tests: we need a test that not only can be passed by an efficient quantum prover, but one that can be passed by a prover that exhibits a certain amount of computational error. (Brakerski et al. 2018) introduced an innovative two-round proof of quantumness based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. However, one of the steps in their protocol (the pre-image test) has low tolerance for error. In this work we present a proof of quantumness which maintains the same circuit structure as (Brakerski et al. 2018) while improving the robustness for noise. Our protocol is based on cryptographically hiding an extended Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state within a sequence of classical bits. Asymptotically, our protocol allows the total probability of error within the circuit to be as high as 1\&minus;O(λ\&minus;C), where λ is the security parameter and C is a constant that can be made arbitrarily large.

Here, we prove that a subclass of Goldilocks QCA -- including the one implemented experimentally -- map onto free fermions and therefore can be classically simulated efficiently. We support this claim with two independent proofs, one involving a Jordan--Wigner transformation and one mapping the integrable six-vertex model to QCA. We compute local conserved quantities of these QCA and predict experimentally measurable expectation values. These calculations can be applied to test large digital quantum computers against known solutions. In contrast, typical Goldilocks QCA have equilibration properties and quasienergy-level statistics that suggest nonintegrability. Still, the latter QCA conserve one quantity useful for error mitigation. Our work provides a parametric quantum circuit with tunable integrability properties with which to test quantum hardware.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Neutrinoless double-beta (0νββ) decay is a heretofore unobserved process which, if observed, would imply that neutrinos are Majorana particles. Interpretations of the stringent experimental constraints on 0νββ-decay half-lives require calculations of nuclear matrix elements. This work presents the first lattice quantum-chromodynamics (LQCD) calculation of the matrix element for 0νββ decay in a multi-nucleon system, specifically the nn\&rarr;ppee transition, mediated by a light left-handed Majorana neutrino propagating over nuclear-scale distances. This calculation is performed with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of mπ=806 MeV at a single lattice spacing and volume. The statistically cleaner Σ\&minus;\&rarr;Σ+ee transition is also computed in order to investigate various systematic uncertainties. The prospects for matching the results of LQCD calculations onto a nuclear effective field theory to determine a leading-order low-energy constant relevant for 0νββ decay with a light Majorana neutrino are investigated. This work, therefore, sets the stage for future calculations at physical values of the quark masses that, combined with effective field theory and nuclear many-body studies, will provide controlled theoretical inputs to experimental searches of 0νββ decay.</p>},

It is natural to consider using a quantum processor based on superconducting circuits to classify microwave signals that are analog -- continuous in time. However, while theoretical proposals of analog QRC exist, to date QRC has been implemented using circuit-model quantum systems -- imposing a discretization of the incoming signal in time, with each time point input by executing a gate operation. In this paper we show how a quantum superconducting circuit comprising an oscillator coupled to a qubit can be used as an analog quantum reservoir for a variety of classification tasks, achieving high accuracy on all of them. Our quantum system was operated without artificially discretizing the input data, directly taking in microwave signals. Our work does not attempt to address the question of whether QRCs could provide a quantum computational advantage in classifying pre-recorded classical signals. However, beyond illustrating that sophisticated tasks can be performed with a modest-size quantum system and inexpensive training, our work opens up the possibility of achieving a different kind of advantage than a purely computational advantage: superconducting circuits can act as extremely sensitive detectors of microwave photons; our work demonstrates processing of ultra-low-power microwave signals in our superconducting circuit, and by combining sensitive detection with QRC processing within the same system, one could achieve a quantum sensing-computational advantage, i.e., an advantage in the overall analysis of microwave signals comprising just a few photon</p>},

While the MPF aims to simultaneously exploit commutator scaling among Hamiltonians and achieve near-optimal time and precision dependence, its lack of a rigorous error bound on the nested commutators renders its practical advantage ambiguous. In this work, we conduct a rigorous complexity analysis of the well-conditioned MPF, demonstrating explicit commutator scaling and near-optimal time and precision dependence at the same time. Using our improved complexity analysis, we present several applications of practical interest where the MPF based on a second-order product formula can achieve a polynomial speedup in both system size and evolution time, as well as an exponential speedup in precision, compared to second-order and even higher-order product formulas. Compared to post-Trotter methods, the MPF based on a second-order product formula can achieve polynomially better scaling in system size, with only poly-logarithmic overhead in evolution time and precision.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum phase estimation is one of the fundamental primitives that underpins many quantum algorithms, including quantum amplitude estimation, the HHL algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, and quantum principal component analysis. Due to its significance as a subroutine, in this work, we study the coherent version of the phase estimation problem, where given an arbitrary input state and black-box access to unitaries U and controlled-U, the goal is to estimate the phases of U in superposition. Unlike most existing phase estimation algorithms, which employ intermediary measurements steps that inevitably destroy coherence, only a couple of algorithms, including the well-known standard quantum phase estimation algorithm, consider this coherent setting. In this work, we propose an improved version of this standard algorithm that utilizes tapering/window functions. Our algorithm, which we call tapered quantum phase estimation algorithm, achieves the optimal query complexity (total number of calls to U and controlled-U) without requiring the use of a computationally expensive quantum sorting network for median computation, which the standard algorithm uses to boost the success probability arbitrarily close to one. We also show that the tapering functions that we use are optimal by formulating optimization problems with different optimization criteria. Beyond the asymptotic regime, we also provide non-asymptotic query complexity of our algorithm, as it is crucial for practical implementation. Finally, we also propose an efficient algorithm that prepares the quantum state corresponding to the optimal tapering function.</p>},

In particular, we derive lower bounds on the achievable mean square error in estimating a linear function of either local phase shifts or quadrature displacements.

Below a critical error rate, stabilizer measurements remove the accumulated magic in the circuit, effectively protecting against coherent errors; above the critical error rate measurements concentrate magic.

However, the Wigner function is ill-suited for much modern quantum-information research, which is focused on finite-dimensional systems and general observables. Instead, recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution\&$\#$39;s extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation, and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution\&$\#$39;s mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity and observables\&$\#$39; incompatibility.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Because of the probabilistic/nondeterministic behavior of quantum programs, it is highly advisable to verify them formally to ensure that they correctly implement their specifications. Formal verification, however, also traditionally requires significant effort. To address this challenge, we present Qafny, an automated proof system based on the program verifier Dafny and designed for verifying quantum programs. At its core, Qafny uses a type-guided quantum proof system that translates quantum operations to classical array operations modeled within a classical separation logic framework. We prove the soundness and completeness of our proof system and implement a prototype compiler that transforms Qafny programs and specifications into Dafny for automated verification purposes. We then illustrate the utility of Qafny\&$\#$39;s automated capabilities in efficiently verifying important quantum algorithms, including quantum-walk algorithms, Grover\&$\#$39;s algorithm, and Shor\&$\#$39;s algorithm.</p>},

In a nutshell, a sponge function takes as input a bit-stream of any length and processes it via a simple iterative procedure: it repeatedly feeds each block of the input into a so-called block function, and then produces a short digest which consists of a subset of the final output bits. While much is known about the post-quantum security of the sponge construction in the case when the block function is modeled as a random function or permutation, the case of invertible permutations, which more accurately models the construction underlying SHA-3, has so far remained a fundamental open problem.<br />In this work, we make new progress towards overcoming this barrier and show several results. First, we prove the \&quot;double-sided zero-search\&quot; conjecture proposed by Unruh (eprint\&$\#$39; 2021) and show that finding zero-pairs in a random 2n-bit permutation requires at least Ω(2n/2) many queries -- and this is tight due to Grover\&$\#$39;s algorithm.

Here, we consider the applicability of erasure qubits to quantum sensing and metrology. We show theoretically that, for the same level of noise, an erasure qubit acts as a more precise sensor or clock compared to its nonerasure counterpart. We experimentally demonstrate this by artificially injecting either erasure errors (in the form of atom loss) or dephasing errors into a differential optical lattice clock comparison, and observe enhanced precision in the case of erasure errors for the same injected error rate. In the context of a clock with repeated measurement cycles, erasure can improve the stability by a factor of 2. Similar benefits of erasure qubits to sensing can be realized in other quantum platforms like Rydberg atoms and superconducting qubits.</p>},

Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss\&$\#$39;s laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a Z2 lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence an expected phase transition.

We refer to such rare transient spikes in the gate error rate as error bursts. In this work, we investigate the resilience of the surface code to generic error bursts. We assume that, after appropriate mitigation strategies, the spike in the error rate lasts for only a single syndrome extraction cycle; we also assume that the enhanced error rate is uniform across the code block. Under these assumptions, and for a circuit-level depolarizing noise model, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine the regime in burst error rate and background error rate for which the memory time becomes arbitrarily long as the code block size grows.

	abstract = {<p>Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the Z2 and U(1) lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the Z2 lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique.

In Gaussian Boson Sampling these are given by hafnians of generalized circular orthogonal ensemble matrices. In a companion work [arXiv:2312.08433], we develop a graph-theoretic method to study these moments and use it to identify a transition in anticoncentration. In this work, we find a recursive expression for the second moment using these graph-theoretic techniques. While we have not been able to solve this recursion by hand, we are able to solve it numerically exactly, which we do up to Fock sector 2n=80. We further derive new analytical results about the second moment.

	abstract = {<p>Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum Hamiltonian simulation, which simulates the evolution of quantum systems and probes quantum phenomena, is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. Recent experimental results suggest that Hamiltonian-oriented analog quantum simulation would be advantageous over circuit-oriented digital quantum simulation in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machine era. However, programming analog quantum simulators is much more challenging due to the lack of a unified interface between hardware and software. In this paper, we design and implement SimuQ, the first framework for quantum Hamiltonian simulation that supports Hamiltonian programming and pulse-level compilation to heterogeneous analog quantum simulators. Specifically, in SimuQ, front-end users specify the target quantum system with Hamiltonian Modeling Language, and the Hamiltonian-level programmability of analog quantum simulators is specified through a new abstraction called the abstract analog instruction set (AAIS) and programmed in AAIS Specification Language by hardware providers. Through a solver-based compilation, SimuQ generates executable pulse schedules for real devices to simulate the evolution of desired quantum systems, which is demonstrated on superconducting (IBM), neutral-atom (QuEra), and trapped-ion (IonQ) quantum devices. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantages of exposing the Hamiltonian-level programmability of devices with native operations or interaction-based gates and establish a small benchmark of quantum simulation to evaluate SimuQ\&$\#$39;s compiler with the above analog quantum simulators.</p>},

	year = {2024},
	month = {05/29/2024},
	abstract = {<p>The current theoretical framework for topological phases of matter is based on the thermodynamic limit of a system with geometrically local interactions. A natural question is to what extent the notion of a phase of matter remains well-defined if we relax the constraint of geometric locality, and replace it with a weaker graph-theoretic notion of k-locality. As a step towards answering this question, we analyze the stability of the energy gap to perturbations for Hamiltonians corresponding to general quantum low-density parity-check codes, extending work of Bravyi and Hastings [Commun. Math. Phys. 307, 609 (2011)]. A corollary of our main result is that if there exist constants ε1,ε2\&gt;0 such that the size Γ(r) of balls of radius r on the interaction graph satisfy Γ(r)=O(exp(r1\&minus;ε1)) and the local ground states of balls of radius r\&le;ρ\&lowast;=O(log(n)1+ε2) are locally indistinguishable, then the energy gap of the associated Hamiltonian is stable against local perturbations. This gives an almost exponential improvement over the D-dimensional Euclidean case, which requires Γ(r)=O(rD) and ρ\&lowast;=O(nα) for some α\&gt;0. The approach we follow falls just short of proving stability of finite-rate qLDPC codes, which have ε1=0; we discuss some strategies to extend the result to these cases. We discuss implications for the third law of thermodynamics, as k-local Hamiltonians can have extensive zero-temperature entropy.</p>},

We give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm which can find the cut using O(n/ϵ2) many copies of the state, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Our algorithm also generalizes to learn the entanglement structure of arbitrary product states. In the special case of Haar-random states, we further show that our algorithm requires circuits of only constant depth. To develop our algorithm, we introduce a state generalization of the hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) which might be of independent interest, in which one is given a quantum state invariant under an unknown subgroup action, with the goal of learning the hidden symmetry subgroup. We show how the hidden cut problem can be formulated as a StateHSP with a carefully chosen Abelian group action. We then prove that Fourier sampling on the hidden cut state produces similar outcomes as a variant of the well-known Simon\&$\#$39;s problem, allowing us to find the hidden cut efficiently. Therefore, our algorithm can be interpreted as an extension of Simon\&$\#$39;s algorithm to entanglement testing. We discuss possible applications of StateHSP and hidden cut problems to cryptography and pseudorandomness.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), the interaction of a two-level system with a high quality factor (Q) cavity, is a foundational building block in different architectures for quantum computation, communication, and metrology. The strong interaction between the atom and the cavity enables single photon operation which is required for quantum gates and sources. Cold atoms, quantum dots, and color centers in crystals are amongst the systems that have shown single photon operations, but they require significant physical infrastructure. Atomic vapors, on the other hand, require limited experimental infrastructure and are hence much easier to deploy outside a laboratory, but they produce an ensemble of moving atoms that results in short interaction times involving multiple atoms, which can hamper quantum operations. A solution to this issue can be found in nanophotonic cavities, where light-matter interaction is enhanced and the volume of operation is small, so that fast single-atom, single-photon operations are enabled. In this work, we study the interaction of an atomically-clad microring resonator (ACMRR) with different-sized ensembles of Rb atoms. We demonstrate strong coupling between an ensemble of ~50 atoms interacting with a high-quality factor (Q \&gt; 4 x 10^5) ACMRR, yielding a many-atom cooperativity C ~ 5.5. We continue to observe signatures of atom-photon interaction for a few (\&lt; 3) atoms, for which we observe saturation at the level of one intracavity photon. Further development of our platform, which includes integrated thermo-optic heaters to enable cavity tuning and stabilization, should enable the observation of interactions between single photons and single atoms.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Simulating fermionic systems on a quantum computer requires representing fermionic states using qubits. The complexity of many simulation algorithms depends on the complexity of implementing rotations generated by fermionic creation-annihilation operators, and the space depends on the number of qubits used. While standard fermion encodings like Jordan-Wigner are space optimal for arbitrary fermionic systems, physical symmetries like particle conservation can reduce the number of physical configurations, allowing improved space complexity. Such space saving is only feasible if the gate overhead is small, suggesting a (quantum) data structures problem, wherein one would like to minimize space used to represent a fermionic state, while still enabling efficient rotations. We define a structure which naturally captures mappings from fermions to systems of qubits. We then instantiate it in two ways, giving rise to two new second-quantized fermion encodings of F fermions in M modes. An information theoretic minimum of I:=\&lceil;log(MF)\&rceil; qubits is required for such systems, a bound we nearly match over the entire parameter regime.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;(1) Our first construction uses I+o(I) qubits when F=o(M), and allows rotations generated by creation-annihilation operators in O(I) gates and O(logMloglogM) depth.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;(2) Our second construction uses I+O(1) qubits when F=Θ(M), and allows rotations generated by creation-annihilation operators in O(I3) gates.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;In relation to comparable prior work, the first represents a polynomial improvement in both space and gate complexity (against Kirby et al. 2022), and the second represents an exponential improvement in gate complexity at the cost of only a constant number of additional qubits (against Harrison et al. or Shee et al. 2022), in the described parameter regimes.</p>},

Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an internal pseudo-spin or \&quot;fiber\&quot; degree of freedom, and the fiber\&$\#$39;s Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates.

In this work, we present an error correction protocol built on a bilayer architecture that aims to reduce operational overheads when restricted to 2D local gates by measuring some generators less frequently than others. We investigate the family of bivariate bicycle qLDPC codes and show that they are well suited for a parallel syndrome measurement scheme using fast routing with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Through circuit-level simulations, we find that in some parameter regimes bivariate bicycle codes implemented with this protocol have logical error rates comparable to the surface code while using fewer physical qubits.</p>},

Its effectiveness depends on identifying input parameters that yield high-quality solutions. However, understanding the complexity of training QAOA remains an under-explored area. Previous results have given analytical performance guarantees for a small, fixed number of parameters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, barren plateaus are likely to emerge at Ω(n) parameters for n qubits. In this work, we study the difficulty of training in the intermediate regime, which is the focus of most current numerical studies and near-term hardware implementations. Through extensive numerical analysis of the quality and quantity of local minima, we argue that QAOA landscapes can exhibit a superpolynomial growth in the number of low-quality local minima even when the number of parameters scales logarithmically with n. This means that the common technique of gradient descent from randomly initialized parameters is doomed to fail beyond small n, and emphasizes the need for good initial guesses of the optimal parameters.\&nbsp;</p>},

Combining complex interactions with photonic synthetic materials provides an opportunity to investigate novel quantum phases and phenomena, establishing interesting connections to condensed matter physics. Here we explore many-body phenomena with a single artificial atom coupled to the many discrete modes of a photonic crystal. This experiment reaches the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime using the circuit quantum electrodynamics paradigm, by galvanically coupling a highly nonlinear fluxonium qubit to a tight-binding lattice of microwave resonators. In this regime, the transport of a single photon becomes a many-body problem, owing to the strong participation of multi-photon bound states arising from interactions that break particle number conservation. Exploiting the effective photon-photon interactions mediated by the qubit, the transport of multiple photons leads to complex multimode dynamics that can be employed for generating a continuous reservoir of strongly-correlated photons, an important resource for quantum networks.

For any orientation of the membrane, one can define (generically nonunitary) dynamics across the membrane; we explore this dynamics in various space-time translation-invariant (STTI) stabilizer circuits in one and two spatial dimensions. We find that the flux of information across the membrane in these STTI circuits reaches a steady state. In the cases where this dynamics is nonunitary and the steady state flux is nonzero, this occurs because the dynamics across the membrane is unitary in a subspace of extensive entropy. This generalized unitarity is present in a broad class of STTI stabilizer circuits, and is also present in some special non-stabilizer models. The existence of multiple unitary (or generalized unitary) directions forces the entanglement membrane tension to be a piecewise linear function of the orientation of the membrane; in this respect, the entanglement membrane behaves like an interface in a zero-temperature classical lattice model. We argue that entanglement membranes in random stabilizer circuits that produce volume-law entanglement are also effectively at zero temperature.</p>},

	month = {11/15/2023},
	abstract = {<p>Accurate modeling of noise in realistic quantum processors is critical for constructing fault-tolerant quantum computers. While a full simulation of actual noisy quantum circuits provides information about correlated noise among all qubits and is therefore accurate, it is, however, computationally expensive as it requires resources that grow exponentially with the number of qubits. In this paper, we propose an efficient systematic construction of approximate noise channels, where their accuracy can be enhanced by incorporating noise components with higher qubit-qubit correlation degree. To formulate such approximate channels, we first present a method, dubbed the cluster expansion approach, to decompose the Lindbladian generator of an actual Markovian noise channel into components based on interqubit correlation degree. We then generate a k-th order approximate noise channel by truncating the cluster expansion and incorporating noise components with correlations up to the k-th degree. We require that the approximate noise channels must be accurate and also \&quot;honest\&quot;, i.e., the actual errors are not underestimated in our physical models. As an example application, we apply our method to model noise in a three-qubit quantum processor that stabilizes a [[2,0,0]] codeword, which is one of the four Bell states. We find that, for realistic noise strength typical for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits coupled via always-on static interactions, correlated noise beyond two-qubit correlation can significantly affect the code simulation accuracy. Since our approach provides a systematic noise characterization, it enables the potential for accurate, honest and scalable approximation to simulate large numbers of qubits from full modeling or experimental characterizations of small enough quantum subsystems, which are efficient but still retain essential noise features of the entire device.</p>},

It can be used for supervised learning when combined with classical gradient-based optimizers.

Inspired by the success of the neural tangent kernels (NTKs) in probing into the dynamics of classical neural networks, a recent line of works proposes to study over-parameterized QNNs by examining a quantum version of tangent kernels. In this work, we study the dynamics of QNNs and show that contrary to popular belief it is qualitatively different from that of any kernel regression: due to the unitarity of quantum operations, there is a non-negligible deviation from the tangent kernel regression derived at the random initialization. As a result of the deviation, we prove the at-most sublinear convergence for QNNs with Pauli measurements, which is beyond the explanatory power of any kernel regression dynamics. We then present the actual dynamics of QNNs in the limit of over-parameterization. The new dynamics capture the change of convergence rate during training and implies that the range of measurements is crucial to the fast QNN convergence.</p>},

We analyze Markovian autonomous decoders that can be implemented with a wide range of qubit and bosonic error-correcting codes, and derive several upper bounds and a lower bound on the logical error rate in terms of correction and noise rates. For many-body quantum codes, we show that, to achieve error suppression comparable to active error correction, autonomous decoders generally require correction rates that grow with code size. For codes with a threshold, we show that it is possible to achieve faster-than-polynomial decay of the logical error rate with code size by using superlogarithmic scaling of the correction rate. We illustrate our results with several examples. One example is an exactly solvable global dissipative toric code model that can achieve an effective logical error rate that decreases exponentially with the linear lattice size, provided that the recovery rate grows proportionally with the linear lattice size.</p>},

In particular, we show how to non-destructively measure the oscillator phase using conditional occupation-number addition and post selection.

Discrete time crystals exhibit rigid subharmonic oscillations, which result from a combination of many-body interactions, collective synchronization, and ergodicity breaking. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in the study of quantum and classical discrete time crystals. We focus on the breaking of ergodicity as the key to discrete time crystals and the delaying of ergodicity as the source of numerous phenomena that share many of the properties of discrete time crystals, including the AC Josephson effect, coupled map lattices, and Faraday waves. Theoretically, there exists a diverse array of strategies to stabilize time crystalline order in both closed and open systems, ranging from localization and prethermalization to dissipation and error correction. Experimentally, many-body quantum simulators provide a natural platform for investigating signatures of time crystalline order; recent work utilizing trapped ions, solid-state spin systems, and superconducting qubits will be reviewed.

	month = {12/22/2023},
	abstract = {<p>As quantum devices make steady progress towards intermediate scale and fault-tolerant quantum computing, it is essential to develop rigorous and efficient measurement protocols that account for known sources of noise. Most existing quantum characterization protocols such as gate set tomography and randomized benchmarking assume the noise acting on the qubits is Markovian. However, this assumption is often not valid, as for the case of 1/f charge noise or hyperfine nuclear spin noise. Here, we present a general framework for quantum process tomography (QPT) in the presence of time-correlated noise. We further introduce fidelity benchmarks that quantify the relative strength of different sources of Markovian and non-Markovian noise. As an application of our method, we perform a comparative theoretical and experimental analysis of silicon spin qubits. We first develop a detailed noise model that accounts for the dominant sources of noise and validate the model against experimental data. Applying our framework for time-correlated QPT, we find that the number of independent parameters needed to characterize one and two-qubit gates can be compressed by 10x and 100x, respectively, when compared to the fully generic case. These compressions reduce the amount of tomographic measurements needed in experiment, while also significantly speeding up numerical simulations of noisy quantum circuit dynamics compared to time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation. Using this compressed noise model, we find good agreement between our theoretically predicted process fidelities and two qubit interleaved randomized benchmarking fidelities of 99.8\% measured in recent experiments on silicon spin qubits. More broadly, our formalism can be directly extended to develop efficient and scalable tuning protocols for high-fidelity control of large-arrays of quantum devices with non-Markovian noise.</p>},

To show this, we prove that the output distribution of such circuits never anticoncentrates \&mdash; meaning it is never too \&quot;flat\&quot; \&mdash; regardless of the depth of the circuit. This is in stark contrast to the behavior of noiseless random quantum circuits or those with only unital noise, both of which anticoncentrate at sufficiently large depths.

We introduce a potential path towards this goal based on a family of dynamically generated quantum error correcting codes that we call \&quot;hyperbolic Floquet codes.\&quot; These codes are defined by a specific sequence of non-commuting two-body measurements arranged periodically in time that stabilize a topological code on a hyperbolic manifold with negative curvature. We focus on a family of lattices for n qubits that, according to our prescription that defines the code, provably achieve a finite encoding rate (1/8+2/n) and have a depth-3 syndrome extraction circuit. Similar to hyperbolic surface codes, the distance of the code at each time-step scales at most logarithmically in n. The family of lattices we choose indicates that this scaling is achievable in practice. We develop and benchmark an efficient matching-based decoder that provides evidence of a threshold near 0.1\% in a phenomenological noise model. Utilizing weight-two check operators and a qubit connectivity of 3, one of our hyperbolic Floquet codes uses 400 physical qubits to encode 52 logical qubits with a code distance of 8, i.e., it is a [[400,52,8]] code.

	abstract = {<p>Low-depth random circuit codes possess many desirable properties for quantum error correction but have so far only been analyzed in the code capacity setting where it is assumed that encoding gates and syndrome measurements are noiseless. In this work, we design a fault-tolerant distillation protocol for preparing encoded states of one-dimensional random circuit codes even when all gates and measurements are subject to noise. This is sufficient for fault-tolerant quantum memory since these encoded states can then be used as ancillas for Steane error correction. We show through numerical simulations that our protocol can correct erasure errors up to an error rate of 2\%. In addition, we also extend results in the code capacity setting by developing a maximum likelihood decoder for depolarizing noise similar to work by Darmawan et al. As in their work, we formulate the decoding problem as a tensor network contraction and show how to contract the network efficiently by exploiting the low-depth structure. Replacing the tensor network with a so-called \&$\#$39;\&$\#$39;tropical\&$\#$39;\&$\#$39; tensor network, we also show how to perform minimum weight decoding.

In particular, we identify a subtle but crucial gap that appears in several ROM and QROM security proofs for signature schemes that are based on the Fiat-Shamir with aborts paradigm, including Dilithium. The gap lies in the CMA-to-NMA reduction and was uncovered when trying to formalize a variant of the QROM security proof by Kiltz, Lyubashevsky, and Schaffner (Eurocrypt 2018). The gap was confirmed by the authors, and there seems to be no simple patch for it.

	abstract = {<p>Today\&$\#$39;s mechanical sensors are capable of detecting extremely weak perturbations while operating near the standard quantum limit. However, further improvements can be made in both sensitivity and bandwidth when we reduce the noise originating from the process of measurement itself -- the quantum-mechanical backaction of measurement -- and go below this \&$\#$39;standard\&$\#$39; limit, possibly approaching the Heisenberg limit. One of the ways to eliminate this noise is by measuring a quantum nondemolition variable such as the momentum in a free-particle system. Here, we propose and characterize theoretical models for direct velocity measurement that utilize traditional electric and magnetic transducer designs to generate a signal while enabling this backaction evasion. We consider the general readout of this signal via electric or magnetic field sensing by creating toy models analogous to the standard optomechanical position-sensing problem, thereby facilitating the assessment of measurement-added noise. Using simple models that characterize a wide range of transducers, we find that the choice of readout scheme -- voltage or current -- for each mechanical detector configuration implies access to either the position or velocity of the mechanical sub-system. This in turn suggests a path forward for key fundamental physics experiments such as the direct detection of dark matter particles.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>With a focus on universal quantum computing for quantum simulation, and through the example of lattice gauge theories, we introduce rather general quantum algorithms that can efficiently simulate certain classes of interactions consisting of correlated changes in multiple (bosonic and fermionic) quantum numbers with non-trivial functional coefficients. In particular, we analyze diagonalization of Hamiltonian terms using a singular-value decomposition technique, and discuss how the achieved diagonal unitaries in the digitized time-evolution operator can be implemented. The lattice gauge theory studied is the SU(2) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions coupled to one flavor of staggered fermions, for which a complete quantum-resource analysis within different computational models is presented. The algorithms are shown to be applicable to higher-dimensional theories as well as to other Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. The example chosen further demonstrates the importance of adopting efficient theoretical formulations: it is shown that an explicitly gauge-invariant formulation using loop, string, and hadron degrees of freedom simplifies the algorithms and lowers the cost compared with the standard formulations based on angular-momentum as well as the Schwinger-boson degrees of freedom. The loop-string-hadron formulation further retains the non-Abelian gauge symmetry despite the inexactness of the digitized simulation, without the need for costly controlled operations. Such theoretical and algorithmic considerations are likely to be essential in quantumly simulating other complex theories of relevance to nature.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>In this work we first examine the hardness of solving various search problems by hybrid quantum-classical strategies, namely, by algorithms that have both quantum and classical capabilities. We then construct a hybrid quantum-classical search algorithm and analyze its success probability. Regarding the former, for search problems that are allowed to have multiple solutions and in which the input is sampled according to arbitrary distributions we establish their hybrid quantum-classical query complexities -- i.e., given a fixed number of classical and quantum queries, determine what is the probability of solving the search task. At a technical level, our results generalize the framework for hybrid quantum-classical search algorithms proposed by Rosmanis. Namely, for an arbitrary distribution D on Boolean functions, the probability an algorithm equipped with τc classical and τq quantum queries succeeds in finding a preimage of 1 for a function sampled from D is at most νD\&sdot;(2τc\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;+2τq+1)2, where νD captures the average (over D) fraction of preimages of 1. As applications of our hardness results, we first revisit and generalize the security of the Bitcoin protocol called the Bitcoin backbone, to a setting where the adversary has both quantum and classical capabilities, presenting a new hybrid honest majority condition necessary for the protocol to properly operate. Secondly, we examine the generic security of hash functions against hybrid adversaries. Regarding our second contribution, we design a hybrid algorithm which first spends all of its classical queries and in the second stage runs a {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}modified Grover\&$\#$39;\&$\#$39; where the initial state depends on the distribution D. We show how to analyze its success probability for arbitrary target distributions and, importantly, its optimality for the uniform and the Bernoulli distribution cases.</p>},

Even with NLTS now solved, there remain many independent and unresolved prerequisites to the QPCP Conjecture, such as the NLSS Conjecture of [GL22]. In this work we focus on a specific and natural prerequisite to both NLSS and the QPCP Conjecture, namely, the existence of local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states all require ω(logn) T gates to prepare. In fact, we prove a stronger result which is not necessarily implied by either conjecture: we construct local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require Ω(n) T gates. Following a previous work [CCNN23], we further show that our procedure can be applied to the NLTS Hamiltonians of [ABN22] to yield local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require both Ω(logn)-depth and Ω(n) T gates to prepare.

Furthermore, working in the thermodynamic limit, we use uniform-matrix-product-state tensor networks to construct multi-particle wave-packet states, evolve them in time, and detect outgoing particles post collision. This facilitates the numerical simulation of scattering experiments in both confined and deconfined regimes of the model at different energies, giving rise to rich phenomenology, including inelastic production of quark and meson states, meson disintegration, and dynamical string formation and breaking. We obtain elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections, together with time-resolved momentum and position distributions of the outgoing particles.

However, hardware errors in noisy near-term devices remain a major obstacle for applications. Ideas based on the randomization of Suzuki-Trotter product formulas have been shown to be a powerful approach to reducing the errors of quantum simulation and lowering the gate count. In this paper, we study the performance of non-unitary simulation channels and consider the error structure of channels constructed from a weighted average of unitary circuits. We show that averaging over just a few simulation circuits can significantly reduce the Trotterization error for both single-step short-time and multi-step long-time simulations. We focus our analysis on two approaches for constructing circuit ensembles for averaging: (i) permuting the order of the terms in the Hamiltonian and (ii) applying a set of global symmetry transformations. We compare our analytical error bounds to empirical performance and show that empirical error reduction surpasses our analytical estimates in most cases. Finally, we test our method on an IonQ trapped-ion quantum computer accessed via the Amazon Braket cloud platform, and benchmark the performance of the averaging approach.</p>},

The algorithm is numerically stable and allows for the computation of n-pion correlation functions for n\&isin;{1,\&hellip;,N} using a single N\&times;N matrix decomposition, improving on previous algorithms. We apply the algorithm to calculations of correlation functions with up to 6144 π+s using two ensembles of gauge field configurations generated with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass mπ=170 MeV and spacetime volumes of (4.43\&times;8.8) fm4 and (5.83\&times;11.6) fm4. We also discuss statistical techniques for the analysis of such systems, in which the correlation functions vary over many orders of magnitude. In particular, we observe that the many-pion correlation functions are well approximated by log-normal distributions, allowing the extraction of the energies of these systems. Using these energies, the large-isospin-density, zero-baryon-density region of the QCD phase diagram is explored. A peak is observed in the energy density at an isospin chemical potential μI\&sim;1.5mπ, signalling the transition into a Bose-Einstein condensed phase. The isentropic speed of sound in the medium is seen to exceed the ideal-gas (conformal) limit (c2s\&le;1/3) over a wide range of chemical potential before falling towards the asymptotic expectation at μI\&sim;15mπ. These, and other thermodynamic observables, indicate that the isospin chemical potential must be large for the system to be well described by an ideal gas or perturbative QCD.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>All known optical materials have an index of refraction of order unity. Despite the tremendous implications that an ultrahigh index could have for optical technologies, little research has been done on why the refractive index of materials is universally small, and whether this observation is fundamental. Here, we investigate the index of an ordered arrangement of atoms, as a function of atomic density. At dilute densities, this problem falls into the realm of quantum optics, where atoms do not interact with one another except via the scattering of light. On the other hand, when the lattice constant becomes comparable to the Bohr radius, the electronic orbitals begin to overlap, giving rise to quantum chemistry. We present a minimal model that allows for a unifying theory of index spanning these two regimes. A key aspect is the treatment of multiple light scattering, which can be highly non-perturbative over a large density range, and which is the reason that conventional theories of the index break down. In the quantum optics regime, we show that ideal light-matter interactions can have a single-mode nature, allowing for a purely real refractive index that grows with density as (N/V)1/3. At the onset of quantum chemistry, we show how two physical mechanisms (excited electron tunneling dynamics and the buildup of electronic density-density correlations) can open up inelastic or spatial multi-mode light scattering processes, which ultimately reduce the index back to order unity while introducing absorption. Around the onset of chemistry, our theory predicts that ultrahigh index (n\&sim;30), low-loss materials could in principle be allowed by the laws of nature.\&nbsp;</p>},

The goal is to infer as much information per probe as possible. If the input is optimal, the information gained per probe can exceed any value achievable classically. The problem is that, only after the interaction does the metrologist learn which input would have been optimal. The metrologist can attempt to change the input by effectively teleporting the optimal input back in time, via entanglement manipulation.

However, extending these concepts to non-equilibrium systems is an outstanding challenge. Despite recent progress in the study of dynamical phases, the universality classes and scaling laws for non-equilibrium phenomena are far less understood than those in equilibrium. In this work, using a trapped-ion quantum simulator with single-ion resolution, we investigate the non-equilibrium nature of critical fluctuations following a quantum quench to the critical point. We probe the scaling of spin fluctuations after a series of quenches to the critical Hamiltonian of a long-range Ising model. With systems of up to 50 spins, we show that the amplitude and timescale of the post-quench fluctuations scale with system size with distinct universal critical exponents. While a generic quench can lead to thermal critical behaviour, we find that a second quench from one critical state to another (i.e. a double quench) results in critical behaviour that does not have an equilibrium counterpart. Our results demonstrate the ability of quantum simulators to explore universal scaling beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>},

Fifty years ago, Dyson and Thouless pointed out that a phase transition in 1D can occur in the presence of long-range interactions, but an experimental realization has so far not been achieved due to the requirement to both prepare equilibrium states and realize sufficiently long-range interactions. Here we report on the first experimental demonstration of a finite-energy phase transition in 1D. We use the simple observation that finite-energy states can be prepared by time-evolving product initial states and letting them thermalize under the dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian. By preparing initial states with different energies in a 1D trapped-ion quantum simulator, we study the finite-energy phase diagram of a long-range interacting quantum system. We observe a ferromagnetic equilibrium phase transition as well as a crossover from a low-energy polarized paramagnet to a high-energy unpolarized paramagnet in a system of up to 23 spins, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our work demonstrates the ability of quantum simulators to realize and study previously inaccessible phases at finite energy density.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Bosonic Gaussian states are a special class of quantum states in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space that are relevant to universal continuous-variable quantum computation as well as to near-term quantum sampling tasks such as Gaussian Boson Sampling. In this work, we study entanglement within a set of squeezed modes that have been evolved by a random linear optical unitary. We first derive formulas that are asymptotically exact in the number of modes for the R{\'e}nyi-2 Page curve (the average R{\'e}nyi-2 entropy of a subsystem of a pure bosonic Gaussian state) and the corresponding Page correction (the average information of the subsystem) in certain squeezing regimes. We then prove various results on the typicality of entanglement as measured by the R{\'e}nyi-2 entropy by studying its variance. Using the aforementioned results for the R{\'e}nyi-2 entropy, we upper and lower bound the von Neumann entropy Page curve and prove certain regimes of entanglement typicality as measured by the von Neumann entropy. Our main proofs make use of a symmetry property obeyed by the average and the variance of the entropy that dramatically simplifies the averaging over unitaries. In this light, we propose future research directions where this symmetry might also be exploited. We conclude by discussing potential applications of our results and their generalizations to Gaussian Boson Sampling and to illuminating the relationship between entanglement and computational complexity.</p>},

We investigate how the choice of such a mapping interacts with the underlying qubit connectivity of the quantum processor to enable (or impede) parallelization of the resulting Hamiltonian-simulation algorithm. It is shown that this problem can be mapped to a path coloring problem on a graph constructed from the particular choice of encoding fermions onto qubits and the fermionic interactions onto paths. The basic version of this problem is called the weak coloring problem. Taking into account the fine-grained details of the mapping yields what is called the strong coloring problem, which leads to improved parallelization performance. A variety of illustrative analytical and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the amount of improvement for both weak and strong coloring-based parallelizations.

Motivated by the projective structure of quantum mechanics, we develop the notion of t-designs on the projective torus, which, surprisingly, have a much more restricted structure than their counterparts on full tori. We provide various constructions of these projective toric designs and prove some bounds on their size and characterizations of their structure. We draw connections between projective toric designs and a diverse set of mathematical objects, including difference and Sidon sets from the field of additive combinatorics, symmetric, informationally complete positive operator valued measures (SIC-POVMs) and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) (which are conjectured to relate to finite projective geometry) from quantum information theory, and crystal ball sequences of certain root lattices. Using these connections, we prove bounds on the maximal size of dense Btmodm sets. We also use projective toric designs to construct families of quantum state designs.

	month = {11/13/2023},
	abstract = {<p>The combination of quantum many-body and machine learning techniques has recently proved to be a fertile ground for new developments in quantum computing. Several works have shown that it is possible to classically efficiently predict the expectation values of local observables on all states within a phase of matter using a machine learning algorithm after learning from data obtained from other states in the same phase. However, existing results are restricted to phases of matter such as ground states of gapped Hamiltonians and Gibbs states that exhibit exponential decay of correlations. In this work, we drop this requirement and show how it is possible to learn local expectation values for all states in a phase, where we adopt the Lindbladian phase definition by Coser \&amp; P{\'e}rez-Garc{\'\i}a [Coser \&amp; P{\'e}rez-Garc{\'\i}a, Quantum 3, 174 (2019)], which defines states to be in the same phase if we can drive one to other rapidly with a local Lindbladian. This definition encompasses the better-known Hamiltonian definition of phase of matter for gapped ground state phases, and further applies to any family of states connected by short unitary circuits, as well as non-equilibrium phases of matter, and those stable under external dissipative interactions. Under this definition, we show that N=O(log(n/δ)2polylog(1/ϵ)) samples suffice to learn local expectation values within a phase for a system with n qubits, to error ϵ with failure probability δ. This sample complexity is comparable to previous results on learning gapped and thermal phases, and it encompasses previous results of this nature in a unified way. Furthermore, we also show that we can learn families of states which go beyond the Lindbladian definition of phase, and we derive bounds on the sample complexity which are dependent on the mixing time between states under a Lindbladian evolution.</p>},

For comparison, the best known classical algorithm uses O~(n4+n3/ε2) queries and O~(n6+n5/ε2) additional arithmetic operations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantum speedup for volume estimation. Our algorithm is based on a refined framework for speeding up simulated annealing algorithms that might be of independent interest. This framework applies in the setting of \&quot;Chebyshev cooling\&quot;, where the solution is expressed as a telescoping product of ratios, each having bounded variance.

It has been an open problem for twenty years whether there is an efficient quantum algorithm for finding such a path, or if the path-finding problem is hard even for quantum computers. We show that a natural class of efficient quantum algorithms provably cannot find a path from entrance to exit. Specifically, we consider algorithms that, within each branch of their superposition, always store a set of vertex labels that form a connected subgraph including the entrance, and that only provide these vertex labels as inputs to the oracle. While this does not rule out the possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a path, it is unclear how an algorithm could benefit by deviating from this behavior.

	abstract = {<p>Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate nuclear processes that are classically intractable. With the goal of understanding the necessary quantum resources, we employ state-of-the-art Hamiltonian-simulation methods, and conduct a thorough algorithmic analysis, to estimate the qubit and gate costs to simulate low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) of nuclear physics. In particular, within the framework of nuclear lattice EFT, we obtain simulation costs for the leading-order pionless and pionful EFTs. We consider both static pions represented by a one-pion-exchange potential between the nucleons, and dynamical pions represented by relativistic bosonic fields coupled to non-relativistic nucleons. We examine the resource costs for the tasks of time evolution and energy estimation for physically relevant scales. We account for model errors associated with truncating either long-range interactions in the one-pion-exchange EFT or the pionic Hilbert space in the dynamical-pion EFT, and for algorithmic errors associated with product-formula approximations and quantum phase estimation. Our results show that the pionless EFT is the least costly to simulate and the dynamical-pion theory is the costliest. We demonstrate how symmetries of the low-energy nuclear Hamiltonians can be utilized to obtain tighter error bounds on the simulation algorithm. By retaining the locality of nucleonic interactions when mapped to qubits, we achieve reduced circuit depth and substantial parallelization. We further develop new methods to bound the algorithmic error for classes of fermionic Hamiltonians that preserve the number of fermions, and demonstrate that reasonably tight Trotter error bounds can be achieved by explicitly computing nested commutators of Hamiltonian terms.

A conventional approach to quantum speedups in optimization relies on the quantum acceleration of intermediate steps of classical algorithms, while keeping the overall algorithmic trajectory and solution quality unchanged. We propose Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), which is derived from the path integral of dynamical systems referring to the continuous-time limit of classical gradient descent algorithms, as a truly quantum counterpart of classical gradient methods where the contribution from classically-prohibited trajectories can significantly boost QHD\&$\#$39;s performance for non-convex optimization. Moreover, QHD is described as a Hamiltonian evolution efficiently simulatable on both digital and analog quantum computers. By embedding the dynamics of QHD into the evolution of the so-called Quantum Ising Machine (including D-Wave and others), we empirically observe that the D-Wave-implemented QHD outperforms a selection of state-of-the-art gradient-based classical solvers and the standard quantum adiabatic algorithm, based on the time-to-solution metric, on non-convex constrained quadratic programming instances up to 75 dimensions.

	abstract = {<p>Quantum computing devices can now perform sampling tasks which, according to complexity-theoretic and numerical evidence, are beyond the reach of classical computers. This raises the question of how one can efficiently verify that a quantum computer operating in this regime works as intended. In 2008, Shepherd and Bremner proposed a protocol in which a verifier constructs a unitary from the comparatively easy-to-implement family of so-called IQP circuits, and challenges a prover to execute it on a quantum computer. The challenge problem is designed to contain an obfuscated secret, which can be turned into a statistical test that accepts samples from a correct quantum implementation. It was conjectured that extracting the secret from the challenge problem is NP-hard, so that the ability to pass the test constitutes strong evidence that the prover possesses a quantum device and that it works as claimed. Unfortunately, about a decade later, Kahanamoku-Meyer found an efficient classical secret extraction attack. Bremner, Cheng, and Ji very recently followed up by constructing a wide-ranging generalization of the original protocol. Their IQP Stabilizer Scheme has been explicitly designed to circumvent the known weakness. They also suggested that the original construction can be made secure by adjusting the problem parameters. In this work, we develop a number of secret extraction attacks which are effective against both new approaches in a wide range of problem parameters. The important problem of finding an efficient and reliable verification protocol for sampling-based proofs of quantum supremacy thus remains open.</p>},

In this work, we apply the concepts of shadow state tomography to the challenge of characterizing quantum processes. We make use of the Choi isomorphism to directly apply rigorous bounds from shadow state tomography to shadow process tomography, and we find additional bounds on the number of measurements that are unique to process tomography. Our results, which include algorithms for implementing shadow process tomography enable new techniques including evaluation of channel concatenation and the application of channels to shadows of quantum states.

	abstract = {<p>Demonstrations of quantum computational advantage and benchmarks of quantum processors via quantum random circuit sampling are based on evaluating the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB). A key question in the theory of XEB is whether it approximates the fidelity of the quantum state preparation. Previous works have shown that the XEB generically approximates the fidelity in a regime where the noise rate per qudit ε satisfies εN<<1 for a system of N qudits and that this approximation breaks down at large noise rates. Here, we show that the breakdown of XEB as a fidelity proxy occurs as a sharp phase transition at a critical value of εN that depends on the circuit architecture and properties of the two-qubit gates, including in particular their entangling power. We study the phase transition using a mapping of average two-copy quantities to statistical mechanics models in random quantum circuit architectures with full or one-dimensional connectivity. We explain the phase transition behavior in terms of spectral properties of the transfer matrix of the statistical mechanics model and identify two-qubit gate sets that exhibit the largest noise robustness.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. Recent experimental results suggest that continuous-time analog quantum simulation would be advantageous over gate-based digital quantum simulation in the Noisy Intermediate-Size Quantum (NISQ) machine era. However, programming such analog quantum simulators is much more challenging due to the lack of a unified interface between hardware and software, and the only few known examples are all hardware-specific. In this paper, we design and implement SimuQ, the first domain-specific language for Hamiltonian simulation that supports pulse-level compilation to heterogeneous analog quantum simulators. Specifically, in SimuQ, front-end users will specify the target Hamiltonian evolution with a Hamiltonian modeling language, and the programmability of analog simulators is specified through a new abstraction called the abstract analog instruction set by hardware providers. Through a solver-based compilation, SimuQ will generate the pulse-level instruction schedule on the target analog simulator for the desired Hamiltonian evolution, which has been demonstrated on pulse-controlled superconducting (Qiskit Pulse) and neutral-atom (QuEra Bloqade) quantum systems, as well as on normal circuit-based digital quantum machines. Moreover, we also demonstrate the advantage of analog compilation over digital compilation on IBM machines, the use of SimuQ for resource estimation for hypothetical machines, and a scalability test of SimuQ\&$\#$39;s compilation.</p>},

Our results apply to quantum annealing protocols with faster convergence than usually guaranteed by a standard adiabatic theorem.

Making this concept precise enough to test requires consistent models. Here we construct an explicit example of a theory where a non-entangling version of an arbitrary two-body potential V(r) arises from local measurements and feedback forces. While a variety of such theories exist, our construction causes particularly strong decoherence compared to more subtle approaches. Regardless, expectation values of observables obey the usual classical dynamics, while the interaction generates no entanglement. Applied to the Newtonian potential, this produces a non-relativistic model of gravity with fundamental loss of unitarity. The model contains a pair of free parameters, a substantial range of which is not excluded by observations to date. As an alternative to testing entanglement properties, we show that the entire remaining parameter space can be tested by looking for loss of quantum coherence in small systems like atom interferometers coupled to oscillating source masses.</p>},

Inquiry: It can be hard to program MPCs correctly and efficiently using existing languages and frameworks, especially when they require coordinating disparate computational roles. How can we make this easier? Approach: We present Symphony, a new functional programming language for MPCs among two or more parties. Symphony starts from the single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) semantics of prior MPC languages, in which each party carries out symmetric responsibilities, and generalizes it using constructs that can coordinate many parties. Symphony introduces **first-class shares** and **first-class party sets** to provide unmatched language-level expressive power with high efficiency. Knowledge: Developing a core formal language called λ-Symphony, we prove that the intuitive, generalized SIMD view of a program coincides with its actual distributed semantics. Thus the programmer can reason about her programs by reading them from top to bottom, even though in reality the program runs in a coordinated fashion, distributed across many machines. We implemented a prototype interpreter for Symphony leveraging multiple cryptographic backends. With it we wrote a variety of MPC programs, finding that Symphony can express optimized protocols that other languages cannot, and that in general Symphony programs operate efficiently.

On the one hand, for generic homogeneous linear ODEs, by proving worst-case lower bounds, we show that quantum algorithms suffer from computational overheads due to two types of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}non-quantumness\&$\#$39;\&$\#$39;: real part gap and non-normality of the coefficient matrix. We then show that homogeneous ODEs in the absence of both types of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}non-quantumness\&$\#$39;\&$\#$39; are equivalent to quantum dynamics, and reach the conclusion that quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics work best. We generalize our results to the inhomogeneous case and find that existing generic quantum ODE solvers cannot be substantially improved. To obtain these lower bounds, we propose a general framework for proving lower bounds on quantum algorithms that are amplifiers, meaning that they amplify the difference between a pair of input quantum states. On the other hand, we show how to fast-forward quantum algorithms for solving special classes of ODEs which leads to improved efficiency. More specifically, we obtain quadratic improvements in the evolution time T for inhomogeneous ODEs with a negative semi-definite coefficient matrix, and exponential improvements in both T and the spectral norm of the coefficient matrix for inhomogeneous ODEs with efficiently implementable eigensystems, including various spatially discretized linear evolutionary partial differential equations.

We consider a quantum system initialized in a pure state and whose evolution is goverened by a Hamiltonian H; a measurement can later estimate the time t for which the system has evolved. In this work, we introduce and study a fundamental trade-off which relates the amount by which noise reduces the accuracy of a quantum clock to the amount of information about the energy of the clock that leaks to the environment. Specifically, we consider an idealized scenario in which Alice prepares an initial pure state of the clock, allows the clock to evolve for a time t that is not precisely known, and then transmits the clock through a noisy channel to Bob. The environment (Eve) receives any information that is lost. We prove that Bob\&$\#$39;s loss of quantum Fisher information (QFI) about t is equal to Eve\&$\#$39;s gain of QFI about a complementary energy parameter. We also prove a more general trade-off that applies when Bob and Eve wish to estimate the values of parameters associated with two non-commuting observables. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the accuracy of the clock to be unaffected by the noise. These are a subset of the Knill-Laflamme error-correction conditions; states satisfying these conditions are said to form a metrological code. We provide a scheme to construct metrological codes in the stabilizer formalism. We show that there are metrological codes that cannot be written as a quantum error-correcting code with similar distance in which the Hamiltonian acts as a logical operator, potentially offering new schemes for constructing states that do not lose any sensitivity upon application of a noisy channel.

	abstract = {<p>Gaussian Boson Sampling is a promising method for experimental demonstrations of quantum advantage because it is easier to implement than other comparable schemes. While most of the properties of Gaussian Boson Sampling are understood to the same degree as for these other schemes, we understand relatively little about the statistical properties of its output distribution. The most relevant statistical property, from the perspective of demonstrating quantum advantage, is the anticoncentration of the output distribution as measured by its second moment. The degree of anticoncentration features in arguments for the complexity-theoretic hardness of Gaussian Boson Sampling, and it is also important to know when using cross-entropy benchmarking to verify experimental performance. In this work, we develop a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing the moments of the Gaussian Boson Sampling distribution. Using this framework, we show that Gaussian Boson Sampling undergoes a transition in anticoncentration as a function of the number of modes that are initially squeezed compared to the number of photons measured at the end of the circuit. When the number of initially squeezed modes scales sufficiently slowly with the number of photons, there is a lack of anticoncentration. However, if the number of initially squeezed modes scales quickly enough, the output probabilities anticoncentrate weakly.</p>},

	month = {5/17/2023},
	abstract = {<p>The low-energy spectrum and scattering of two-nucleon systems are studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics using a variational approach. A wide range of interpolating operators are used: dibaryon operators built from products of plane-wave nucleons, hexaquark operators built from six localized quarks, and quasi-local operators inspired by two-nucleon bound-state wavefunctions in low-energy effective theories. Sparsening techniques are used to compute the timeslice-to-all quark propagators required to form correlation-function matrices using products of these operators. Projection of these matrices onto irreducible representations of the cubic group, including spin-orbit coupling, is detailed. Variational methods are applied to constrain the low-energy spectra of two-nucleon systems in a single finite volume with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 806 MeV. Results for S- and D-wave phase shifts in the isospin singlet and triplet channels are obtained under the assumption that partial-wave mixing is negligible. Tests of interpolating-operator dependence are used to investigate the reliability of the energy spectra obtained and highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of variational methods. These studies and comparisons to previous studies using the same gauge-field ensemble demonstrate that interpolating-operator dependence can lead to significant effects on the two-nucleon energy spectra obtained using both variational and non-variational methods, including missing energy levels and other discrepancies. While this study is inconclusive regarding the presence of two-nucleon bound states at this quark mass, it provides robust upper bounds on two-nucleon energy levels that can be improved in future calculations using additional interpolating operators and is therefore a step toward reliable nuclear spectroscopy from the underlying Standard Model of particle physics.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum computers are now on the brink of outperforming their classical counterparts. One way to demonstrate the advantage of quantum computation is through quantum random sampling performed on quantum computing devices. However, existing tools for verifying that a quantum device indeed performed the classically intractable sampling task are either impractical or not scalable to the quantum advantage regime. The verification problem thus remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we experimentally demonstrate efficiently verifiable quantum random sampling in the measurement-based model of quantum computation on a trapped-ion quantum processor. We create random cluster states, which are at the heart of measurement-based computing, up to a size of 4 x 4 qubits. Moreover, by exploiting the structure of these states, we are able to recycle qubits during the computation to sample from entangled cluster states that are larger than the qubit register. We then efficiently estimate the fidelity to verify the prepared states--in single instances and on average--and compare our results to cross-entropy benchmarking. Finally, we study the effect of experimental noise on the certificates. Our results and techniques provide a feasible path toward a verified demonstration of a quantum advantage.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of \&quot;green\&quot; tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>We extend entropy production to a deeply quantum regime involving noncommuting conserved quantities. Consider a unitary transporting conserved quantities (\&quot;charges\&quot;) between two systems initialized in thermal states. Three common formulae model the entropy produced. They respectively cast entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable, as an information-theoretic uncertainty measure, and as a quantifier of irreversibility. Often, the charges are assumed to commute with each other (e.g., energy and particle number). Yet quantum charges can fail to commute. Noncommutation invites generalizations, which we posit and justify, of the three formulae. Charges\&$\#$39; noncommutation, we find, breaks the formulae\&$\#$39;s equivalence. Furthermore, different formulae quantify different physical effects of charges\&$\#$39; noncommutation on entropy production. For instance, entropy production can signal contextuality - true nonclassicality - by becoming nonreal.

	pages = {020360},
	abstract = {<p>Although quantum computation (QC) is regarded as a promising numerical method for computational quantum chemistry, current applications of quantum-chemistry calculations on quantum computers are limited to small molecules. This limitation can be ascribed to technical problems in building and manipulating more qubits and the associated complicated operations of quantum gates in a quantum circuit when the size of the molecular system becomes large. As a result, reducing the number of required qubits is necessary to make QC practical. Currently, the minimal STO-3G basis set is commonly used in benchmark studies because it requires the minimum number of spin orbitals. Nonetheless, the accuracy of using STO-3G is generally low and thus cannot provide useful predictions. We propose to adopt Daubechies wavelet functions as an accurate and efficient method for QCs of molecular electronic properties. We demonstrate that a minimal basis set constructed from Daubechies wavelet basis can yield accurate results through a better description of the molecular Hamiltonian, while keeping the number of spin orbitals minimal. With the improved Hamiltonian through Daubechies wavelets, we calculate vibrational frequencies for H2 and LiH using quantum-computing algorithm to show that the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. As a result, we achieve quantum calculations in which accuracy is comparable with that of the full configuration interaction calculation using the cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas the computational cost is the same as that of a STO-3G calculation. Thus, our work provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the molecular Hamiltonian for efficient QCs of molecular systems, and for the first time demonstrates that predictions in agreement with experimental measurements are possible to be achieved with quantum resources available in near-term quantum computers.</p>},

This is an extension of the result [CC21], which originally proved this result for D=3. To see why this is interesting, note that, while the D=1 case of this result follows from standard use of Matrix Product States, known for decades, the D=2 case required novel and interesting techniques introduced in [BGM19]. Extending to the case D=3 was even more laborious and required further new techniques introduced in [CC21]. Our work here shows that, while handling each new dimension has historically required a new insight, and fixed algorithmic primitive, based on known techniques for D\&le;3, we can now handle any fixed dimension D\&gt;3.<br />Our algorithm uses the Divide-and-Conquer framework of [CC21] to approximate the desired quantity via several instantiations of the same problem type, each involving D-dimensional circuits on about half the number of qubits as the original. This division step is then applied recursively, until the width of the recursively decomposed circuits in the Dth dimension is so small that they can effectively be regarded as (D\&minus;1)-dimensional problems by absorbing the small width in the Dth dimension into the qudit structure at the cost of a moderate increase in runtime. The main technical challenge lies in ensuring that the more involved portions of the recursive circuit decomposition and error analysis from [CC21] still hold in higher dimensions, which requires small modifications to the analysis in some places.</p>},

While multiple open-source quantum compilation and circuit optimization frameworks are available, e.g. IBM Qiskit, CQC Tket, Google Cirq, Rigetti Quilc, PyZX, their relative performance is not always clear to a quantum programmer. The growth of complexity and diversity of quantum circuit compilation algorithms creates a demand for a dedicated tool for cross-benchmarking and profiling of inner workflow of the quantum compilation stack. We present an open-source software package, Arline Benchmarks, that is designed to perform automated benchmarking of quantum compilers with the focus on NISQ applications. The name \&quot;Arline\&quot; was given in honour of Arline Greenbaum Feynman, the first wife of Richard Feynman, the pioneer of quantum computing. We compared several quantum compilation frameworks based on a set of important metrics such as post-optimization gate counts, circuit depth, hardware-dependent circuit cost function, compiler run time etc. with a detailed analysis of metrics for each compilation stage. We performed a variety of compiler tests for random circuits and structured quantum algorithms (VQE, Trotter decomposition, Grover search, Option Pricing via Amplitude Estimation) for several popular quantum hardware architectures. Leveraging cross-platform functionality of Arline, we propose a concept of composite compilation pipeline that combines compiler-specific circuit optimization subroutines in a single compilation stack and finds an optimized sequence of compilation passes. By providing detailed insights into the compilation flow of quantum compilers, Arline Benchmarks offers a valuable toolkit for quantum computing researchers and software developers to gain additional insights into compilers\&$\#$39; characteristics.</p>},

The goal of this Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage (C2QA) project is to develop an instruction set architecture (ISA) for hybrid qubit/bosonic mode systems that contains an inventory of the fundamental operations and measurements that are possible in such hardware. The corresponding abstract machine model (AMM) would also contain a description of the appropriate error models associated with the gates, measurements and time evolution of the hardware.

Qiskit is an opensource software development toolkit (SDK) for simulating the quantum state of a quantum circuit on a system with Python 3.7+ and for running the same circuits on prototype hardware within the IBM Quantum Lab. We introduce the Bosonic Qiskit software to enable the simulation of hybrid qubit/bosonic systems using the existing Qiskit software development kit. This implementation can be used for simulating new hybrid systems, verifying proposed physical systems, and modeling systems larger than can currently be constructed.

For such SDPs, we show that the optimiser matrix is unique and moreover this uniqueness is robust to small deviations from the quantum bound. Further, we consider a generalised scenario in presence of quantum channels and draw analogies in the structure of Bell and sequential inequalities using the pseudo-density matrix formalism.

	abstract = {<p>(3+1)D topological phases of matter can host a broad class of non-trivial topological defects of codimension-1, 2, and 3, of which the well-known point charges and flux loops are special cases. The complete algebraic structure of these defects defines a higher category, and can be viewed as an emergent higher symmetry. This plays a crucial role both in the classification of phases of matter and the possible fault-tolerant logical operations in topological quantum error correcting codes. In this paper, we study several examples of such higher codimension defects from distinct perspectives. We mainly study a class of invertible codimension-2 topological defects, which we refer to as twist strings. We provide a number of general constructions for twist strings, in terms of gauging lower dimensional invertible phases, layer constructions, and condensation defects. We study some special examples in the context of Z2 gauge theory with fermionic charges, in Z2\&times;Z2 gauge theory with bosonic charges, and also in non-Abelian discrete gauge theories based on dihedral (Dn) and alternating (A6) groups. The intersection between twist strings and Abelian flux loops sources Abelian point charges, which defines an H4 cohomology class that characterizes part of an underlying 3-group symmetry of the topological order. The equations involving background gauge fields for the 3-group symmetry have been explicitly written down for various cases. We also study examples of twist strings interacting with non-Abelian flux loops (defining part of a non-invertible higher symmetry), examples of non-invertible codimension-2 defects, and examples of interplay of codimension-2 defects with codimension-1 defects. We also find an example of geometric, not fully topological, twist strings in (3+1)D A6 gauge theory.</p>},

This is particularly problematic when the processes of interest are complicated, such as interactions among excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In this paper, we describe a framework combining machine learning (ML) models with physics-based traditional analyses to identify and track multiple solitonic excitations in images of BECs. We use an ML-based object detector to locate the solitonic excitations and develop a physics-informed classifier to sort solitonic excitations into physically motivated subcategories. Lastly, we introduce a quality metric quantifying the likelihood that a specific feature is a longitudinal soliton. Our trained implementation of this framework, SolDet, is publicly available as an open-source python package. SolDet is broadly applicable to feature identification in cold-atom images when trained on a suitable user-provided dataset.</p>},

The standard approach assumes at least two spatially separated devices. Recently, Metger and Vidick [Quantum, 2021] showed that a single EPR pair of a single quantum device can be self-tested under standard computational assumptions. In this work, we generalize their techniques to give the first protocol that self-tests N EPR pairs and measurements in the single-device setting under the same computational assumptions. We show that our protocol can be passed with probability negligibly close to 1 by an honest quantum device using poly(N) resources. Moreover, we show that any quantum device that fails our protocol with probability at most ϵ must be poly(N,ϵ)-close to being honest in the appropriate sense. In particular, a simplified version of our protocol is the first that can efficiently certify an arbitrary number of qubits of a cloud quantum computer, on which we cannot enforce spatial separation, using only classical communication.</p>},

In most physical systems, however, the interactions are short-ranged, hindering the emergence of such phases in one dimension. Here we use a one-dimensional trapped-ion quantum simulator to prepare states with long-range spin order that extends over the system size of up to 23 spins and is characteristic of the continuous symmetry-breaking phase of matter. Our preparation relies on simultaneous control over an array of tightly focused individual-addressing laser beams, generating long-range spin-spin interactions. We also observe a disordered phase with frustrated correlations. We further study the phases at different ranges of interaction and the out-of-equilibrium response to symmetry-breaking perturbations.

We recast existing experimental protocols for continuous-variable tomography in the classical-shadow framework, obtaining rigorous bounds on the sample complexity for estimating density matrices from these protocols. We analyze the efficiency of homodyne, heterodyne, photon number resolving (PNR), and photon-parity protocols. To reach a desired precision on the classical shadow of an N-photon density matrix with a high probability, we show that homodyne detection requires an order O(N5) measurements in the worst case, whereas PNR and photon-parity detection require O(N4) measurements in the worst case (both up to logarithmic corrections). We benchmark these results against numerical simulation as well as experimental data from optical homodyne experiments. We find that numerical and experimental homodyne tomography significantly outperforms our bounds, exhibiting a more typical scaling of the number of measurements that is close to linear in N. We extend our single-mode results to an efficient construction of multimode shadows based on local measurements.</p>},

Despite a lot of empirical studies and recent progress in theoretical understanding of VQE\&$\#$39;s optimization landscape, the convergence for optimizing VQE is far less understood. We provide the first rigorous analysis of the convergence of VQEs in the over-parameterization regime. By connecting the training dynamics with the Riemannian Gradient Flow on the unit-sphere, we establish a threshold on the sufficient number of parameters for efficient convergence, which depends polynomially on the system dimension and the spectral ratio, a property of the problem Hamiltonian, and could be resilient to gradient noise to some extent. We further illustrate that this overparameterization threshold could be vastly reduced for specific VQE instances by establishing an ansatz-dependent threshold paralleling our main result. We showcase that our ansatz-dependent threshold could serve as a proxy of the trainability of different VQE ansatzes without performing empirical experiments, which hence leads to a principled way of evaluating ansatz design. Finally, we conclude with a comprehensive empirical study that supports our theoretical findings</p>},

CoVault uses a new multi-party implementation of functional encryption (FE) for secure analytics, which relies on a unique combination of secret sharing, multi-party secure computation (MPC), and different trusted execution environments (TEEs). CoVault is secure under a very strong threat model that tolerates compromise and side-channel attacks on any one of a small set of parties and their TEEs. Despite the cost of MPC, we show that CoVault scales to very large data sizes using map-reduce based query parallelization.

However, promising parameterized quantum applications, e.g., quantum walk and unitary implementation, cannot be trained in the existing framework due to the natural involvement of unbounded loops. To fill in the gap, we provide the first differentiable quantum programming framework with unbounded loops, including a newly designed differentiation rule, code transformation, and their correctness proof. Technically, we introduce a randomized estimator for derivatives to deal with the infinite sum in the differentiation of unbounded loops, whose applicability in classical and probabilistic programming is also discussed. We implement our framework with Python and Q$\#$, and demonstrate a reasonable sample efficiency.

Furthermore, through a detailed analysis of the special case in which the couplings are genuinely random and independent, we find that the standard formulation of Lieb-Robinson bounds is insufficient to capture the complexity of the dynamics -- we must distinguish between bounds which hold for all sites of the chain and bounds which hold for a subsequence of sites, and we show by explicit example that these two can have dramatically different behaviors. All the same, our result for the dynamical exponent is tight, in that we prove by counterexample that there cannot exist any Lieb-Robinson bound with a smaller exponent.

Due to its fundamental importance, a plethora of quantum compilers has been designed in past years. However, there are several caveats to current protocols, which are low optimality, high inference time, limited scalability, and lack of universality. To compensate for these defects, here we devise an efficient and practical quantum compiler assisted by advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, i.e., data generation, deep Q-learning, and AQ* search. In this way, our protocol is compatible with various quantum machines and can be used to compile multi-qubit operators. We systematically evaluate the performance of our proposal in compiling quantum operators with both inverse-closed and inverse-free universal basis sets. In the task of single-qubit operator compiling, our proposal outperforms other RL-based quantum compilers in the measure of compiling sequence length and inference time. Meanwhile, the output solution is near-optimal, guaranteed by the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Notably, for the inverse-free universal basis set, the achieved sequence length complexity is comparable with the inverse-based setting and dramatically advances previous methods. These empirical results contribute to improving the inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev theorem. In addition, for the first time, we demonstrate how to leverage RL-based quantum compilers to accomplish two-qubit operator compiling. The achieved results open an avenue for integrating RL with quantum compiling to unify efficiency and practicality and thus facilitate the exploration of quantum advantages.</p>},

To achieve this, we improve upon the Carleman linearization approach introduced in [1] to obtain a faster convergence rate under the condition RD\&lt;1, where RD measures the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the l\&infin; norm. Since RD is independent of the number of spatial grid points n while R increases with n, the criterion RD\&lt;1 is significantly milder than R\&lt;1 for high-dimensional systems and can stay convergent under grid refinement for approximating PDEs.

A digital, {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}site-by-site\&$\#$39;\&$\#$39; scheme of state preparation was introduced in arXiv:1911.03505 as a way to prepare the vacuum state of certain fermionic field theory Hamiltonians with a mass gap. More generally, this algorithm may be used to prepare ground states of Hamiltonians by adding one site at a time as long as successive intermediate ground states share a non-zero overlap and the Hamiltonian has a non-vanishing spectral gap at finite lattice size. In this paper, we study the ground state overlap as a function of the number of sites for a range of quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians. Using analytical formulas known for free fermions, we are able to explore the large-N behavior and draw conclusions about the state overlap. For all models studied, we find that the overlap remains large (e.g. \&gt;0.1) up to large lattice sizes (N=64,72) except near quantum phase transitions or in the presence of gapless edge modes. For one-dimensional systems, we further find that two N/2-site ground states also share a large overlap with the N-site ground state everywhere except a region near the phase boundary. Based on these numerical results, we additionally propose a recursive alternative to the site-by-site state preparation algorithm.</p>},

Lett. 120, 067003 (2018)], considerable research efforts have been dedicated to the study of Cooper pairing order parameters constrained (or obstructed) by the nontrivial normal-state band topology at Fermi surfaces in 3D systems. In the current work, we generalize the topologically obstructed pairings between Chern states (like the monopole Cooper pairing) by proposing Euler obstructed Cooper pairing in 3D systems. The Euler obstructed Cooper pairing widely exists between two Fermi surfaces with nontrivial band topology characterized by nonzero Euler numbers; such Fermi surfaces can exist in 3D PT-protected spinless-Dirac/nodal-line semimetals with negligible spin-orbit coupling, where PT is the space-time inversion symmetry. An Euler obstructed pairing channel must have pairing nodes on the pairing-relevant Fermi surfaces, and the total winding number of the pairing nodes is determined by the sum or difference of the Euler numbers on the Fermi surfaces. In particular, we find that when the normal state is time-reversal invariant and the pairing is weak, a sufficiently-dominant Euler obstructed pairing channel with zero total momentum leads to nodal superconductivity. If the Fermi surface splitting is small, the resultant nodal superconductor hosts hinge Majorana zero modes. The possible dominance of the Euler obstructed pairing channel near the superconducting transition and the robustness of the hinge Majorana zero modes against disorder are explicitly demonstrated using effective or tight-binding models.

	abstract = {<p>Quantum simulators have recently enabled experimental observations of quantum many-body systems\&$\#$39; internal thermalisation. Often, the global energy and particle number are conserved, and the system is prepared with a well-defined particle number - in a microcanonical subspace. However, quantum evolution can also conserve quantities, or charges, that fail to commute with each other. Noncommuting charges have recently emerged as a subfield at the intersection of quantum thermodynamics and quantum information. Until now, this subfield has remained theoretical. We initiate the experimental testing of its predictions, with a trapped-ion simulator. We prepare 6-15 spins in an approximate microcanonical subspace, a generalisation of the microcanonical subspace for accommodating noncommuting charges, which cannot necessarily have well-defined nontrivial values simultaneously. We simulate a Heisenberg evolution using laser-induced entangling interactions and collective spin rotations. The noncommuting charges are the three spin components. We find that small subsystems equilibrate to near a recently predicted non-Abelian thermal state. This work bridges quantum many-body simulators to the quantum thermodynamics of noncommuting charges, whose predictions can now be tested.</p>},

Furthermore, we determine that 3D rotations are irreversible under cyclic compression. Consequently, contact-point sliding, which is dissipative, accumulates throughout the cycle. Using numerical simulations whose accuracy our experiment supports, we discover that much of the dissipation occurs in the bulk, where grains rotate more than they translate.

	abstract = {<p>An essential aspect of topological phases of matter is the existence of Wilson loop operators that keep the ground state subspace invariant. Here we present and implement an unbiased numerical optimization scheme to systematically find the Wilson loop operators given a single ground state wave function of a gapped Hamiltonian on a disk. We then show how these Wilson loop operators can be cut and glued through further optimization to give operators that can create, move, and annihilate anyon excitations. We subsequently use these operators to determine the braiding statistics and topological twists of the anyons, yielding a way to fully extract topological order from a single wave function. We apply our method to the ground state of the perturbed toric code and doubled semion models with a magnetic field that is up to a half of the critical value. From a contemporary perspective, this can be thought of as a machine learning approach to discover emergent 1-form symmetries of a ground state wave function.

One of which, IBM quantum computing, presented a road map showing their Kookaburra system with over 4158 qubits will be available in 2025. For the standardization of Post-Quantum Cryptography or PQC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST recently announced the first candidates for standardization with one algorithm for key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber, and three algorithms for digital signatures. NIST has also issued a new call for quantum-safe digital signature algorithms due June 1, 2023. This timeline shows that FIPS-certified quantum-safe TLS protocol would take a predictably long time. However, \&quot;steal now, crack later\&quot; tactic requires protecting data against future quantum threat actors today. NIST recommended the use of a hybrid mode of TLS 1.3 with its extensions to support PQC. The hybrid mode works for certain cases but FIPS certification for the hybridized cryptomodule might still be required. This paper proposes to take a nested mode to enable TLS 1.3 protocol with quantum-safe data, which can be made available today and is FIPS compliant. We discussed the performance impacts of the handshaking phase of the nested TLS 1.3 with PQC and the symmetric encryption phase. The major impact on performance using the nested mode is in the data symmetric encryption with AES. To overcome this performance reduction, we suggest using quantum encryption with a quantum permutation pad for the data encryption with a minor performance reduction of less than 10 percent.</p>},

As applications, we estimate average-case error for digital Hamiltonian simulation of general lattice Hamiltonians and k-local Hamiltonians. In particular, for the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain with n spins, the error is quadratically reduced from O(n) in the worst case to O(n\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;) on average for both the PF method and the Taylor series method.

We show that due to a generalization of the Witten effect and charge-flux attachment, the 1-form symmetry generated by the magnetic defects mixes with other symmetries into a higher group. We describe such higher-group symmetry in various lattice model examples. We discuss several applications, including the classification of fermionic SPT phases in (3+1)D for general fermionic symmetry groups, where we also derive a simpler formula for the [O5]\&isin;H5(BG,U(1)) obstruction than has appeared in previous work. We also show how the d-group symmetry is related to fault-tolerant non-Pauli logical gates and a refined Clifford hierarchy in stabilizer codes.

In conventional thermodynamics, a system of interest and a bath exchange quantities -- energy, particles, electric charge, etc. -- that are globally conserved and are represented by Hermitian operators. These operators were implicitly assumed to commute with each other, until a few years ago. Freeing the operators to fail to commute has enabled many theoretical discoveries -- about reference frames, entropy production, resource-theory models, etc. Little work has bridged these results from abstract theory to experimental reality. This paper provides a methodology for building this bridge systematically: We present an algorithm for constructing Hamiltonians that conserve noncommuting quantities globally while transporting the quantities locally. The Hamiltonians can couple arbitrarily many subsystems together and can be integrable or nonintegrable. Special cases of our construction have appeared in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our Hamiltonians may be realized physically with superconducting qudits, with ultracold atoms, with trapped ions, and in QCD.</p>},

Power-law interactions with strength decaying as 1/rα in the distance r provide an experimentally realizable resource for information processing, whilst still retaining long-range connectivity. We leverage the power of these interactions to implement a fast quantum fanout gate with an arbitrary number of targets. Our implementation allows the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and Shor\&$\#$39;s algorithm to be performed on a D-dimensional lattice in time logarithmic in the number of qubits for interactions with α\&le;D. As a corollary, we show that power-law systems with α\&le;D are difficult to simulate classically even for short times, under a standard assumption that factoring is classically intractable. Complementarily, we develop a new technique to give a general lower bound, linear in the size of the system, on the time required to implement the QFT and the fanout gate in systems that are constrained by a linear light cone. This allows us to prove an asymptotically tighter lower bound for long-range systems than is possible with previously available techniques.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The field of quantum Hamiltonian complexity lies at the intersection of quantum many-body physics and computational complexity theory, with deep implications to both fields. The main object of study is the LocalHamiltonian problem, which is concerned with estimating the ground-state energy of a local Hamiltonian and is complete for the class QMA, a quantum generalization of the class NP. A major challenge in the field is to understand the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian problem in more physically natural parameter regimes. One crucial parameter in understanding the ground space of any Hamiltonian in many-body physics is the spectral gap, which is the difference between the smallest two eigenvalues. Despite its importance in quantum many-body physics, the role played by the spectral gap in the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian is less well-understood. In this work, we make progress on this question by considering the precise regime, in which one estimates the ground-state energy to within inverse exponential precision. Computing ground-state energies precisely is a task that is important for quantum chemistry and quantum many-body physics.<br />In the setting of inverse-exponential precision, there is a surprising result that the complexity of LocalHamiltonian is magnified from QMA to PSPACE, the class of problems solvable in polynomial space. We clarify the reason behind this boost in complexity. Specifically, we show that the full complexity of the high precision case only comes about when the spectral gap is exponentially small. As a consequence of the proof techniques developed to show our results, we uncover important implications for the representability and circuit complexity of ground states of local Hamiltonians, the theory of uniqueness of quantum witnesses, and techniques for the amplification of quantum witnesses in the presence of postselection.</p>},

Limiting ourselves to polygon invariants of motion, we analyze the shape of individual trajectories thus successfully distinguishing integrable motion from chaotic cases. For example, our method rediscovers some of the famous McMillan-Suris integrable mappings and discrete Painlev{\'e} equations. In total, over 100 new integrable families are presented and analyzed; some of them are isolated in the space of parameters, and some of them are families with one parameter (or the ratio of parameters) being continuous or discrete. At the end of the paper, we suggest how newly discovered maps are related to a general 2D symplectic map via an introduction of discrete perturbation theory and propose a method on how to construct smooth near-integrable dynamical systems based on mappings with polygon invariants.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>By leveraging shared entanglement between a pair of qubits, one can teleport a quantum state from one particle to another. Recent advances have uncovered an intrinsically many-body generalization of quantum teleportation, with an elegant and surprising connection to gravity. In particular, the teleportation of quantum information relies on many-body dynamics, which originate from strongly-interacting systems that are holographically dual to gravity; from the gravitational perspective, such quantum teleportation can be understood as the transmission of information through a traversable wormhole. Here, we propose and analyze a new mechanism for many-body quantum teleportation -- dubbed peaked-size teleportation. Intriguingly, peaked-size teleportation utilizes precisely the same type of quantum circuit as traversable wormhole teleportation, yet has a completely distinct microscopic origin: it relies upon the spreading of local operators under generic thermalizing dynamics and not gravitational physics. We demonstrate the ubiquity of peaked-size teleportation, both analytically and numerically, across a diverse landscape of physical systems, including random unitary circuits, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (at high temperatures), one-dimensional spin chains and a bulk theory of gravity with stringy corrections. Our results pave the way towards using many-body quantum teleportation as a powerful experimental tool for: (i) characterizing the size distributions of operators in strongly-correlated systems and (ii) distinguishing between generic and intrinsically gravitational scrambling dynamics. To this end, we provide a detailed experimental blueprint for realizing many-body quantum teleportation in both trapped ions and Rydberg atom arrays; effects of decoherence and experimental imperfections are analyzed.</p>},

Second, we prove, within the framework of the entanglement bootstrap program, that two topologically ordered media connected by a gapped domain wall must have the same modular commutator in their respective bulk. Third, we numerically calculate the value of the modular commutator for a bosonic lattice Laughlin state for finite sizes and extrapolate to the infinite-volume limit. The result of this extrapolation is consistent with the proposed formula up to an error of about 0.7\%.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The dynamics of open quantum systems is generally described by a master equation, which describes the loss of information into the environment. By using a simple model of uncoupled emitters, we illustrate how the recovery of this information depends on the monitoring scheme applied to register the decay clicks. The dissipative dynamics, in this case, is described by pure-state stochastic trajectories and we examine different unravelings of the same master equation. More precisely, we demonstrate how registering the sequence of clicks from spontaneously emitted photons through a linear optical interferometer induces entanglement in the trajectory states. Since this model consists of an array of single-photon emitters, we show a direct equivalence with Fock-state boson sampling and link the hardness of sampling the outcomes of the quantum jumps with the scaling of trajectory entanglement.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Introducing additional tunable parameters to quantum circuits is a powerful way of improving performance without increasing hardware requirements. A recently introduced multi-angle extension of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (ma-QAOA) significantly improves the solution from QAOA by allowing the parameters for each term in the Hamiltonian to vary independently. However, prior results suggest that there is considerable redundancy in parameters, the removal of which would reduce the cost of parameter optimization. In this work, we show numerically that problem symmetries can be used to reduce the number of parameters used by ma-QAOA without decreasing the solution quality. We study MaxCut on all 7,565 connected, non-isomorphic 8-node graphs with a non-trivial symmetry group and show numerically that in 67.4\% of these graphs, symmetry can be used to reduce the number of parameters with no decrease in the objective, with the average ratio of parameters reduced by 28.1\%. Moreover, we show that in 35.9\% of the graphs this can be achieved by simply using the largest symmetry. For the graphs where reducing the number of parameters leads to a decrease in the objective, the largest symmetry can be used to reduce the parameter count by 37.1\% at the cost of only a 6.1\% decrease in the objective.</p>},

We crystallize the relationship in an equation that we prove theoretically and observe experimentally. Our proof-of-principle optical experiment features a filtering technique that we term partially postselected amplification (PPA). Using PPA, we measure a wave plate\&rsquo;s birefringent phase. PPA amplifies, by over two orders of magnitude, the information obtained about the phase per detected photon. In principle, PPA can boost the information obtained from the average filtered photon by an arbitrarily large factor. The filter\&rsquo;s amplification of systematic errors, we find, bounds the theoretically unlimited advantage in practice. PPA can facilitate any phase measurement and mitigates challenges that scale with trial number, such as proportional noise and detector saturation.

Here, we directly probe the properties of the conformal field theories governing these MIPTs using a numerical transfer-matrix method, which allows us to extract the effective central charge, as well as the first few low-lying scaling dimensions of operators at these critical points. Our results provide convincing evidence that the generic and Clifford MIPTs for qubits lie in different universality classes and that both are distinct from the percolation transition for qudits in the limit of large onsite Hilbert space dimension. For the generic case, we find strong evidence of multifractal scaling of correlation functions at the critical point, reflected in a continuous spectrum of scaling dimensions.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Motivated by recent experimental demonstrations of Floquet topological insulators, there have been several theoretical proposals for using structured light, either spatial or spectral, to create other properties such as flat band and vortex states. In particular, the generation of vortex states in a massive Dirac fermion insulator irradiated by light carrying nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been proposed [Kim et al. Phys. Rev. B 105, L081301(2022)]. Here, we evaluate the orbital magnetization and optical conductivity as physical observables for such a system. We show that the OAM of light induces nonzero orbital magnetization and current density. The orbital magnetization density increases linearly as a function of OAM degree. In certain regimes, we find that orbital magnetization density is independent of the system size, width, and Rabi frequency of light. It is shown that the orbital magnetization arising from our Floquet theory is large and can be probed by magnetometry measurements. Furthermore, we study the optical conductivity for various types of electron transitions between different states such as vortex, edge, and bulk that are present in the system. Based on conductance frequency peaks, a scheme for the detection of vortex states is proposed.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Recently, several approaches to solving linear systems on a quantum computer have been formulated in terms of the quantum adiabatic theorem for a continuously varying Hamiltonian. Such approaches enabled near-linear scaling in the condition number κ of the linear system, without requiring a complicated variable-time amplitude amplification procedure. However, the most efficient of those procedures is still asymptotically sub-optimal by a factor of log(κ). Here, we prove a rigorous form of the adiabatic theorem that bounds the error in terms of the spectral gap for intrinsically discrete time evolutions. We use this discrete adiabatic theorem to develop a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems that is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that the complexity is strictly linear in κ, matching a known lower bound on the complexity. Our O(κlog(1/ϵ)) complexity is also optimal in terms of the combined scaling in κ and the precision ϵ. Compared to existing suboptimal methods, our algorithm is simpler and easier to implement. Moreover, we determine the constant factors in the algorithm, which would be suitable for determining the complexity in terms of gate counts for specific applications.</p>},

Our primary example is a Pauli stabilizer model on four-dimensional qudits that belongs to the double semion (DS) phase of matter. The DS stabilizer Hamiltonian is constructed by condensing an emergent boson in a Z4 toric code, where the condensation is implemented by making certain two-body measurements. We rigorously verify the topological order of the DS stabilizer model by identifying an explicit finite-depth quantum circuit (with ancillary qubits) that maps its ground state subspace to that of a DS string-net model. We show that the construction of the DS stabilizer Hamiltonian generalizes to all twisted quantum doubles (TQDs) with Abelian anyons. This yields a Pauli stabilizer code on composite-dimensional qudits for each such TQD, implying that the classification of topological Pauli stabilizer codes extends well beyond stacks of toric codes - in fact, exhausting all Abelian anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary. We also demonstrate that symmetry-protected topological phases of matter characterized by type I and type II cocycles can be modeled by Pauli stabilizer Hamiltonians by gauging certain 1-form symmetries of the TQD stabilizer models.</p>},

Our work both extends the classification of two-dimensional Pauli topological subsystem codes to systems of composite-dimensional qudits and establishes that the classification is at least as rich as that of Abelian anyon theories. We exemplify the construction with topological subsystem codes defined on four-dimensional qudits based on the Z(1)4 anyon theory with degenerate braiding relations and the chiral semion theory--both of which cannot be captured by topological stabilizer codes. The construction proceeds by \&quot;gauging out\&quot; certain anyon types of a topological stabilizer code. This amounts to defining a gauge group generated by the stabilizer group of the topological stabilizer code and a set of anyonic string operators for the anyon types that are gauged out. The resulting topological subsystem code is characterized by an anyon theory containing a proper subset of the anyons of the topological stabilizer code. We thereby show that every Abelian anyon theory is a subtheory of a stack of toric codes and a certain family of twisted quantum doubles that generalize the double semion anyon theory. We further prove a number of general statements about the logical operators of translation invariant topological subsystem codes and define their associated anyon theories in terms of higher-form symmetries.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum many-body systems involving bosonic modes or gauge fields have infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces which must be truncated to perform simulations of real-time dynamics on classical or quantum computers. To analyze the truncation error, we develop methods for bounding the rate of growth of local quantum numbers such as the occupation number of a mode at a lattice site, or the electric field at a lattice link. Our approach applies to various models of bosons interacting with spins or fermions, and also to both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories. We show that if states in these models are truncated by imposing an upper limit Λ on each local quantum number, and if the initial state has low local quantum numbers, then an error at most ϵ can be achieved by choosing Λ to scale polylogarithmically with ϵ\&minus;1, an exponential improvement over previous bounds based on energy conservation. For the Hubbard-Holstein model, we numerically compute a bound on Λ that achieves accuracy ϵ, obtaining significantly improved estimates in various parameter regimes. We also establish a criterion for truncating the Hamiltonian with a provable guarantee on the accuracy of time evolution. Building on that result, we formulate quantum algorithms for dynamical simulation of lattice gauge theories and of models with bosonic modes; the gate complexity depends almost linearly on spacetime volume in the former case, and almost quadratically on time in the latter case. We establish a lower bound showing that there are systems involving bosons for which this quadratic scaling with time cannot be improved. By applying our result on the truncation error in time evolution, we also prove that spectrally isolated energy eigenstates can be approximated with accuracy ϵ by truncating local quantum numbers at Λ=polylog(ϵ\&minus;1).</p>},

Photonics is a promising platform for demonstrating a quantum computational advantage (QCA) by outperforming the most powerful classical supercomputers on a well-defined computational task. Despite this promise, existing proposals and demonstrations face challenges. Experimentally, current implementations of Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) lack programmability or have prohibitive loss rates. Theoretically, there is a comparative lack of rigorous evidence for the classical hardness of GBS. In this work, we make progress in improving both the theoretical evidence and experimental prospects. We provide evidence for the hardness of GBS, comparable to the strongest theoretical proposals for QCA. We also propose a QCA architecture we call high-dimensional GBS, which is programmable and can be implemented with low loss using few optical components. We show that particular algorithms for simulating GBS are outperformed by high-dimensional GBS experiments at modest system sizes.

	abstract = {<p>We introduce a flexible and graphically intuitive framework that constructs complex quantum error correction codes from simple codes or states, generalizing code concatenation. More specifically, we represent the complex code constructions as tensor networks built from the tensors of simple codes or states in a modular fashion. Using a set of local moves known as operator pushing, one can derive properties of the more complex codes, such as transversal non-Clifford gates, by tracing the flow of operators in the network. The framework endows a network geometry to any code it builds and is valid for constructing stabilizer codes as well as non-stabilizer codes over qubits and qudits. For a contractible tensor network, the sequence of contractions also constructs a decoding/encoding circuit. To highlight the framework\&$\#$39;s range of capabilities and to provide a tutorial, we lay out some examples where we glue together simple stabilizer codes to construct non-trivial codes. These examples include the toric code and its variants, a holographic code with transversal non-Clifford operators, a 3d stabilizer code, and other stabilizer codes with interesting properties. Surprisingly, we find that the surface code is equivalent to the 2d Bacon-Shor code after \&quot;dualizing\&quot; its tensor network encoding map.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum many-body scar states are special eigenstates of nonintegrable models with distinctive entanglement features that give rise to infinitely long-lived coherent dynamics under quantum quenches from certain initial states. We elaborate on a construction of quantum many-body scar states in which they emerge from Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states in systems with two layers, wherein the two layers are maximally entangled. We apply this construction to spin systems as well as systems of itinerant fermions and bosons and demonstrate how symmetries can be harnessed to enhance its versatility. We show that several well-known examples of quantum many-body scars, including the tower of states in the spin-1 XY model and the η-pairing states in the Fermi-Hubbard model, can be understood within this formalism. We also demonstrate how an {\it infinite} tower of many-body scar states can emerge in bilayer Bose-Hubbard models with charge conservation.</p>},

	year = {2022},
	month = {11/11/2022},
	abstract = {<p>Many quantum programs are assured by formal verification, but such verification is usually laborious and time-consuming. This paper proposes quantum natural proof (QNP), an automated proof system for verifying hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Natural proofs are a subclass of proofs that are amenable to completely automated reasoning, provide sound but incomplete procedures, and capture common reasoning tactics in program verification. The core of QNP is a type-guided quantum proof system, named Qafny, which views quantum operations as some classical array operations that can be modeled as proof rules in a classical separation logic framework, suitable for automated reasoning. We proved the soundness and completeness of the Qafny proof system as well as the soundness of the proof system compilation from Qafny to Dafny. By using the QNP implementation in Dafny, automated verification can be efficiently perform for many hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, including GHZ, Shor\&$\#$39;s, Grover\&$\#$39;s, and quantum walk algorithms, which saves a great amount of human efforts. In addition, quantum programs written in Qafny can be compiled to quantum circuits so that every verified quantum program can be run on a quantum machine.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum simulation is a prominent application of quantum computers. While there is extensive previous work on simulating finite-dimensional systems, less is known about quantum algorithms for real-space dynamics. We conduct a systematic study of such algorithms. In particular, we show that the dynamics of a d-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger equation with η particles can be simulated with gate complexity O~(ηdFpoly(log(g\&prime;/ϵ))), where ϵ is the discretization error, g\&prime; controls the higher-order derivatives of the wave function, and F measures the time-integrated strength of the potential. Compared to the best previous results, this exponentially improves the dependence on ϵ and g\&prime; from poly(g\&prime;/ϵ) to poly(log(g\&prime;/ϵ)) and polynomially improves the dependence on T and d, while maintaining best known performance with respect to η. For the case of Coulomb interactions, we give an algorithm using η3(d+η)Tpoly(log(ηdTg\&prime;/(Δϵ)))/Δ one- and two-qubit gates, and another using η3(4d)d/2Tpoly(log(ηdTg\&prime;/(Δϵ)))/Δ one- and two-qubit gates and QRAM operations, where T is the evolution time and the parameter Δ regulates the unbounded Coulomb interaction. We give applications to several computational problems, including faster real-space simulation of quantum chemistry, rigorous analysis of discretization error for simulation of a uniform electron gas, and a quadratic improvement to a quantum algorithm for escaping saddle points in nonconvex optimization.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The recovery of an unknown density matrix of large size requires huge computational resources. The recent Factored Gradient Descent (FGD) algorithm and its variants achieved state-of-the-art performance since they could mitigate the dimensionality barrier by utilizing some of the underlying structures of the density matrix. Despite their theoretical guarantee of a linear convergence rate, the convergence in practical scenarios is still slow because the contracting factor of the FGD algorithms depends on the condition number κ of the ground truth state. Consequently, the total number of iterations can be as large as O(κ\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;ln(1ε)) to achieve the estimation error ε. In this work, we derive a quantum state tomography scheme that improves the dependence on κ to the logarithmic scale; namely, our algorithm could achieve the approximation error ε in O(ln(1κε)) steps. The improvement comes from the application of the non-convex Riemannian gradient descent (RGD). The contracting factor in our approach is thus a universal constant that is independent of the given state. Our theoretical results of extremely fast convergence and nearly optimal error bounds are corroborated by numerical results.</p>},

For example, one can use sum types to implement the direct sum of linear operators, exception-handling syntax to implement projective measurements, and aliasing to induce entanglement. Further, Qunity takes advantage of the overlooked BQP subroutine theorem, allowing one to construct reversible subroutines from irreversible quantum algorithms through the uncomputation of \&quot;garbage\&quot; outputs. Unlike existing languages that enable quantum aspects with separate add-ons (like a classical language with quantum gates bolted on), Qunity provides a unified syntax and a novel denotational semantics that guarantees that programs are quantum mechanically valid. We present Qunity\&$\#$39;s syntax, type system, and denotational semantics, showing how it can cleanly express several quantum algorithms.

The allowed operations, fuzzy operations, are slightly random implementations of two-qubit gates chosen by an agent. We formalize two operational tasks, uncomplexity extraction and expenditure.

	abstract = {<p>We consider the classical shadows task for pure states in the setting of both joint and independent measurements. The task is to measure few copies of an unknown pure state ρ in order to learn a classical description which suffices to later estimate expectation values of observables. Specifically, the goal is to approximate Tr(Oρ) for any Hermitian observable O to within additive error ϵ provided Tr(O2)\&le;B and ||O||=1. Our main result applies to the joint measurement setting, where we show Θ~(B\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;ϵ\&minus;1+ϵ\&minus;2) samples of ρ are necessary and sufficient to succeed with high probability. The upper bound is a quadratic improvement on the previous best sample complexity known for this problem. For the lower bound, we see that the bottleneck is not how fast we can learn the state but rather how much any classical description of ρ can be compressed for observable estimation. In the independent measurement setting, we show that O(Bd\&minus;\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;ϵ\&minus;1+ϵ\&minus;2) samples suffice. Notably, this implies that the random Clifford measurements algorithm of Huang, Kueng, and Preskill, which is sample-optimal for mixed states, is not optimal for pure states. Interestingly, our result also uses the same random Clifford measurements but employs a different estimator.</p>},

However, in most practical situations, this Hamiltonian is not precisely known, and ultimately all there is are data obtained from measurements on the system. In this work, we introduce a highly scalable, data-driven approach to learning families of interacting many-body Hamiltonians from dynamical data, by bringing together techniques from gradient-based optimization from machine learning with efficient quantum state representations in terms of tensor networks. Our approach is highly practical, experimentally friendly, and intrinsically scalable to allow for system sizes of above 100 spins. In particular, we demonstrate on synthetic data that the algorithm works even if one is restricted to one simple initial state, a small number of single-qubit observables, and time evolution up to relatively short times. For the concrete example of the one-dimensional Heisenberg model our algorithm exhibits an error constant in the system size and scaling as the inverse square root of the size of the data set.</p>},

Ultracold atom in optical lattice is considered as one of the promising platforms due to its feasible initialization and parallel manipulation.

With only two-layer quantum circuits, the generation utilizes two-qubit entangling gates based on the superexchange interaction in double wells. The parallelism of these operations enables the generation to be fast and scalable. To verify the entanglement of this non-stabilizer state, we mainly design three complementary detection protocols which are less resource-consuming compared to the full tomography. In particular, one just needs two homogenous local measurement settings to identify the entanglement property.

But while the runtime of specific algorithms, notably tensor network algorithms, explicitly depends on the amount of entanglement in the system, it is unknown whether this connection runs deeper and entanglement can also cause inherent, algorithm-independent complexity. In this work, we quantitatively connect the entanglement present in certain quantum systems to the computational complexity of simulating those systems. Moreover, we completely characterize the entanglement and complexity as a function of a system parameter. Specifically, we consider the task of simulating single-qubit measurements of k--regular graph states on n qubits. We show that, as the regularity parameter is increased from 1 to n\&minus;1, there is a sharp transition from an easy regime with low entanglement to a hard regime with high entanglement at k=3, and a transition back to easy and low entanglement at k=n\&minus;3. As a key technical result, we prove a duality for the simulation complexity of regular graph states between low and high regularity.</p>},

The output distributions of local quantum circuits form a particularly interesting class of distributions, of key importance both to quantum advantage proposals and a variety of quantum machine learning algorithms. In this work, we provide an extensive characterization of the learnability of the output distributions of local quantum circuits. Our first result yields insight into the relationship between the efficient learnability and the efficient simulatability of these distributions. Specifically, we prove that the density modelling problem associated with Clifford circuits can be efficiently solved, while for depth d=nΩ(1) circuits the injection of a single T-gate into the circuit renders this problem hard. This result shows that efficient simulatability does not imply efficient learnability. Our second set of results provides insight into the potential and limitations of quantum generative modelling algorithms. We first show that the generative modelling problem associated with depth d=nΩ(1) local quantum circuits is hard for any learning algorithm, classical or quantum. As a consequence, one cannot use a quantum algorithm to gain a practical advantage for this task. We then show that, for a wide variety of the most practically relevant learning algorithms -- including hybrid-quantum classical algorithms -- even the generative modelling problem associated with depth d=ω(log(n)) Clifford circuits is hard.

	abstract = {<p>It is widely expected that systems which fully thermalize are chaotic in the sense of exhibiting random-matrix statistics of their energy level spacings, whereas integrable systems exhibit Poissonian statistics. In this paper, we investigate a third class: spin glasses. These systems are partially chaotic but do not achieve full thermalization due to large free energy barriers. We examine the level spacing statistics of a canonical infinite-range quantum spin glass, the quantum p-spherical model, using an analytic path integral approach. We find statistics consistent with a direct sum of independent random matrices, and show that the number of such matrices is equal to the number of distinct metastable configurations -- the exponential of the spin glass \&quot;complexity\&quot; as obtained from the quantum Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations. We also consider the statistical properties of the complexity itself and identify a set of contributions to the path integral which suggest a Poissonian distribution for the number of metastable configurations. Our results show that level spacing statistics can probe the ergodicity-breaking in quantum spin glasses and provide a way to generalize the notion of spin glass complexity beyond models with a semi-classical limit.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Tailored topological stabilizer codes in two dimensions have been shown to exhibit high storage threshold error rates and improved subthreshold performance under biased Pauli noise. Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes can allow for several advantages including a transversal implementation of non-Clifford logical gates, single-shot decoding strategies, parallelized decoding in the case of fracton codes as well as construction of fractal lattice codes. Motivated by this, we tailor 3D topological codes for enhanced storage performance under biased Pauli noise. We present Clifford deformations of various 3D topological codes, such that they exhibit a threshold error rate of 50\% under infinitely biased Pauli noise. Our examples include the 3D surface code on the cubic lattice, the 3D surface code on a checkerboard lattice that lends itself to a subsystem code with a single-shot decoder, the 3D color code, as well as fracton models such as the X-cube model, the Sierpinski model and the Haah code. We use the belief propagation with ordered statistics decoder (BP-OSD) to study threshold error rates at finite bias. We also present a rotated layout for the 3D surface code, which uses roughly half the number of physical qubits for the same code distance under appropriate boundary conditions. Imposing coprime periodic dimensions on this rotated layout leads to logical operators of weight O(n) at infinite bias and a corresponding exp[\&minus;O(n)] subthreshold scaling of the logical failure rate, where n is the number of physical qubits in the code. Even though this scaling is unstable due to the existence of logical representations with O(1) low-rate Pauli errors, the number of such representations scales only polynomially for the Clifford-deformed code, leading to an enhanced effective distance.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The problem of classifying high-dimensional shapes in real-world data grows in complexity as the dimension of the space increases. For the case of identifying convex shapes of different geometries, a new classification framework has recently been proposed in which the intersections of a set of one-dimensional representations, called rays, with the boundaries of the shape are used to identify the specific geometry. This ray-based classification (RBC) has been empirically verified using a synthetic dataset of two- and three-dimensional shapes [1] and, more recently, has also been validated experimentally [2]. Here, we establish a bound on the number of rays necessary for shape classification, defined by key angular metrics, for arbitrary convex shapes. For two dimensions, we derive a lower bound on the number of rays in terms of the shape\&$\#$39;s length, diameter, and exterior angles. For convex polytopes in R^N, we generalize this result to a similar bound given as a function of the dihedral angle and the geometrical parameters of polygonal faces. This result enables a different approach for estimating high-dimensional shapes using substantially fewer data elements than volumetric or surface-based approaches.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>We study the limitations and fast-forwarding of quantum algorithms for solving linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems with particular focus on non-quantum dynamics, where the coefficient matrix in the ODE is not anti-Hermitian or the ODE is inhomogeneous. On the one hand, for generic homogeneous linear ODEs, by proving worst-case lower bounds, we show that quantum algorithms suffer from computational overheads due to two types of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}non-quantumness\&$\#$39;\&$\#$39;: real part gap and non-normality of the coefficient matrix. We then show that ODEs in the absence of both types of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}non-quantumness\&$\#$39;\&$\#$39; are equivalent to quantum dynamics, and reach the conclusion that quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics work best. We generalize our results to the inhomogeneous case and find that existing generic quantum ODE solvers cannot be substantially improved. To obtain these lower bounds, we propose a general framework for proving lower bounds on quantum algorithms that are amplifiers, meaning that they amplify the difference between a pair of input quantum states. On the other hand, we show how to fast-forward quantum algorithms for solving special classes of ODEs which leads to improved efficiency. More specifically, we obtain quadratic to exponential improvements in terms of the evolution time T and the spectral norm of the coefficient matrix for the following classes of ODEs: inhomogeneous ODEs with a negative definite coefficient matrix, inhomogeneous ODEs with a coefficient matrix having an eigenbasis that can be efficiently prepared on a quantum computer and eigenvalues that can be efficiently computed classically, and the spatially discretized inhomogeneous heat equation and advection-diffusion equation. We give fast-forwarding algorithms that are conceptually different from existing ones in the sense that they neither require time discretization nor solving high-dimensional linear systems.</p>},

We argue that either the QCA is nontrivial, i.e. not a finite-depth circuit of local quantum gates, or there exists a two-dimensional commuting projector Hamiltonian realizing the chiral semion topological order (characterized by U(1)2 Chern-Simons theory). Our QCA is obtained by first constructing the Walker-Wang Hamiltonian of a certain premodular tensor category of order four, then condensing the deconfined bulk boson at the level of lattice operators. We show that the resulting Hamiltonian hosts chiral semion surface topological order in the presence of a boundary and can be realized as a non-Pauli stabilizer code on qubits, from which the QCA is defined. The construction is then generalized to a class of QCAs defined by non-Pauli stabilizer codes on 2n-dimensional qudits that feature surface anyons described by U(1)2n Chern-Simons theory. Our results support the conjecture that the group of nontrivial three-dimensional QCAs is isomorphic to the Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion categories.</p>},

Topological photonics, offering robustness to certain types of disorder as well as chirality, has proved to be a well-suited design principle for numerous applications in recent years. Here we present a new kind of mode taper realized through topological bandgap engineering. We numerically demonstrate a sixfold change in mode width over an extremely compact 8μm distance with near unity efficiency in the optical domain. With suppressed backscattering and no excitation of higher-order modes, such a taper could enable new progress in the development of scalable, multi-component systems in classical and quantum optics.</p>},

This leads to unexpected failures when noisy or otherwise low-quality data is processed by an autonomous system. In this work, we propose a framework for robust autotuning of QD devices that combines a machine learning (ML) state classifier with a data quality control module. The data quality control module acts as a \&quot;gatekeeper\&quot; system, ensuring that only reliable data are processed by the state classifier. Lower data quality results in either device recalibration or termination. To train both ML systems, we enhance the QD simulation by incorporating synthetic noise typical of QD experiments. We confirm that the inclusion of synthetic noise in the training of the state classifier significantly improves the performance, resulting in an accuracy of 95.0(9) \% when tested on experimental data. We then validate the functionality of the data quality control module by showing that the state classifier performance deteriorates with decreasing data quality, as expected.

Here we explore many-body phenomena with a single artificial atom coupled to the many discrete modes of a photonic crystal. This experiment reaches the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime using the circuit QED paradigm, by galvanically coupling a highly nonlinear fluxonium qubit to a tight-binding lattice of microwave resonators. In this regime, the transport of a single photon is strongly modified by the presence of multi-photon bound states, owing to interactions that break particle number conservation. Exploiting the effective photon-photon interactions mediated by the qubit, the driven system can be configured as a continuous reservoir of strongly-correlated photons, a resource of interest for quantum networks.

The succinctness of algebraic reasoning would be especially desirable for scalable analysis of quantum programs, given the involvement of exponential-size matrices in most of the existing methods. A few key features of KAT including the idempotent law and the nice properties of classical tests, however, fail to hold in the context of quantum programs due to their unique quantum features, especially in branching. We propose the Non-idempotent Kleena Algebra (NKA) as a natural alternative and identify complete and sound semantic models for NKA as well as their appropriate quantum interpretations. In light of applications of KAT, we are able to demonstrate algebraic proofs in NKA of quantum compiler optimization and the normal form of quantum while-programs. Moreover, we extend NKA with Tests (i.e., NKAT), where tests model quantum predicates following the rules of effect algebra, and illustrate how to encode propositional quantum Hoare logic as NKAT theorems.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>We construct an explicit and solvable toy model for the AdS/CFT correspondence in the form of an approximate quantum error correction code with a non-trivial center in the code subalgebra. Specifically, we use the Bacon-Shor codes and perfect tensors to construct a gauge code (or a stabilizer code with gauge-fixing), which we call the holographic hybrid code. This code admits a local log-depth encoding/decoding circuit, and can be represented as a holographic tensor network which satisfies an analog of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and reproduces features of the sub-region duality. We then construct approximate versions of the holographic hybrid codes by \&quot;skewing\&quot; the code subspace, where the size of skewing is analogous to the size of the gravitational constant in holography. These approximate hybrid codes are not necessarily stabilizer codes, but they can be expressed as the superposition of holographic tensor networks that are stabilizer codes. For such constructions, different logical states, representing different bulk matter content, can \&quot;back-react\&quot; on the emergent geometry, resembling a key feature of gravity. The locality of the bulk degrees of freedom becomes subspace-dependent and approximate. Such subspace-dependence is manifest in the form of bulk operator reconstruction from the boundary. Exact complementary error correction breaks down for certain bipartition of the boundary degrees of freedom; however, a limited, state-dependent form is preserved for particular subspaces. We also construct an example where the connected two-point correlation functions can have a power-law decay. Coupled with known constraints from holography, a weakly back-reacting bulk also forces these skewed tensor network models to the \&quot;large N limit\&quot; where they are built by concatenating a large N number of copies.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Analog quantum algorithms are formulated in terms of Hamiltonians rather than unitary gates and include quantum adiabatic computing, quantum annealing, and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). These algorithms are promising candidates for near-term quantum applications, but they often require fine tuning via the annealing schedule or variational parameters. In this work, we explore connections between these analog algorithms, as well as limits in which they become approximations of the optimal procedure.Notably, we explore how the optimal procedure approaches a smooth adiabatic procedure but with a superposed oscillatory pattern that can be explained in terms of the interactions between the ground state and first excited state that effect the coherent error cancellation of diabatic transitions. Furthermore, we provide numeric and analytic evidence that QAOA emulates this optimal procedure with the length of each QAOA layer equal to the period of the oscillatory pattern. Additionally, the ratios of the QAOA bangs are determined by the smooth, non-oscillatory part of the optimal procedure. We provide arguments for these phenomena in terms of the product formula expansion of the optimal procedure. With these arguments, we conclude that different analog algorithms can emulate the optimal protocol under different limits and approximations. Finally, we present a new algorithm for better approximating the optimal protocol using the analytic and numeric insights from the rest of the paper. In practice, numerically, we find that this algorithm outperforms standard QAOA and naive quantum annealing procedures.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Cryptography with quantum states exhibits a number of surprising and counterintuitive features. In a 2002 work, Barnum et al. argued informally that these strange features should imply that digital signatures for quantum states are impossible (Barnum et al., FOCS 2002). In this work, we perform the first rigorous study of the problem of signing quantum states. We first show that the intuition of Barnum et al. was correct, by proving an impossibility result which rules out even very weak forms of signing quantum states. Essentially, we show that any non-trivial combination of correctness and security requirements results in negligible security. This rules out all quantum signature schemes except those which simply measure the state and then sign the outcome using a classical scheme. In other words, only classical signature schemes exist. We then show a positive result: it is possible to sign quantum states, provided that they are also encrypted with the public key of the intended recipient. Following classical nomenclature, we call this notion quantum signcryption. Classically, signcryption is only interesting if it provides superior efficiency to simultaneous encryption and signing. Our results imply that, quantumly, it is far more interesting: by the laws of quantum mechanics, it is the only signing method available. We develop security definitions for quantum signcryption, ranging from a simple one-time two-user setting, to a chosen-ciphertext-secure many-time multi-user setting. We also give secure constructions based on post-quantum public-key primitives. Along the way, we show that a natural hybrid method of combining classical and quantum schemes can be used to \&quot;upgrade\&quot; a secure classical scheme to the fully-quantum setting, in a wide range of cryptographic settings including signcryption, authenticated encryption, and chosen-ciphertext security.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Photocurrent (PC) measurements can reveal the relaxation dynamics of photo-excited hot carriers beyond the linear response of conventional transport experiments, a regime important for carrier multiplication. In graphene subject to a magnetic field, PC measurements are able to probe the existence of Landau levels with different edge chiralities which is exclusive to relativistic electron systems. Here, we report the accurate measurement of PC in graphene in the quantum Hall regime. Prominent PC oscillations as a function of gate voltage on samples\&$\#$39; edges are observed. These oscillation amplitudes form an envelope which depends on the strength of the magnetic field, as does the PCs\&$\#$39; power dependence and their saturation behavior. We explain these experimental observations through a model using optical Bloch equations, incorporating relaxations through acoustic-, optical- phonons and Coulomb interactions. The simulated PC agrees with our experimental results, leading to a unified understanding of the chiral PC in graphene at various magnetic field strengths, and providing hints for the occurrence of a sizable carrier multiplication.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Circuit quantum electrodynamics is one of the most promising platforms for efficient quantum simulation and computation. In recent groundbreaking experiments, the immense flexibility of superconducting microwave resonators was utilized to realize hyperbolic lattices that emulate quantum physics in negatively curved space. Here we investigate experimentally feasible settings in which a few superconducting qubits are coupled to a bath of photons evolving on the hyperbolic lattice. We compare our numerical results for finite lattices with analytical results for continuous hyperbolic space on the Poincar{\'e} disk. We find good agreement between the two descriptions in the long-wavelength regime. We show that photon-qubit bound states have a curvature-limited size. We propose to use a qubit as a local probe of the hyperbolic bath, for example by measuring the relaxation dynamics of the qubit. We find that, although the boundary effects strongly impact the photonic density of states, the spectral density is well described by the continuum theory. We show that interactions between qubits are mediated by photons propagating along geodesics. We demonstrate that the photonic bath can give rise to geometrically-frustrated hyperbolic quantum spin models with finite-range or exponentially-decaying interaction.</p>},

However, quantum information devices for sensing and computation require small sizes, lower fields, and better on-chip integration. Equivalences to ferromagnetic order---such as the XY model---can be realized at much lower magnetic fields by using arrays of superconducting islands connected by Josephson junctions.

In experimental systems, however, interactions with the environment cannot generally be ignored, and the extension of Lieb-Robinson bounds to dissipative systems which evolve non-unitarily in time remains an open challenge. In this work, we prove two Lieb-Robinson bounds that constrain the dynamics of open quantum systems with long-range interactions that decay as a power-law in the distance between particles. Using a combination of these Lieb-Robinson bounds and mixing bounds which arise from \&quot;reversibility\&quot; -- naturally satisfied for thermal environments -- we prove the clustering of correlations in the steady states of open quantum systems with long-range interactions. Our work provides an initial step towards constraining the steady-state entanglement structure for a broad class of experimental platforms, and we highlight several open directions regarding the application of Lieb-Robinson bounds to dissipative systems.</p>},

We analyze such processes in detail and establish a complexity transition between simulable and nonsimulable systems as a function of a tuning parameter.

	abstract = {<p>Long-range correlated errors can severely impact the performance of NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) devices, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Characterizing these errors is important for improving the performance of these devices, via calibration and error correction, and to ensure correct interpretation of the results. We propose a compressed sensing method for detecting two-qubit correlated dephasing errors, assuming only that the correlations are sparse (i.e., at most s pairs of qubits have correlated errors, where s \&lt;\&lt; n(n-1)/2, and n is the total number of qubits). In particular, our method can detect long-range correlations between any two qubits in the system (i.e., the correlations are not restricted to be geometrically local).<br />Our method is highly scalable: it requires as few as m = O(s log n) measurement settings, and efficient classical postprocessing based on convex optimization. In addition, when m = O(s log^4(n)), our method is highly robust to noise, and has sample complexity O(max(n,s)^2 log^4(n)), which can be compared to conventional methods that have sample complexity O(n^3). Thus, our method is advantageous when the correlations are sufficiently sparse, that is, when s \&lt; O(n^(3/2) / log^2(n)). Our method also performs well in numerical simulations on small system sizes, and has some resistance to state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors. The key ingredient in our method is a new type of compressed sensing measurement, which works by preparing entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states (GHZ states) on random subsets of qubits, and measuring their decay rates with high precision.</p>},

Such an approach is also at the heart of evaluating metrological standards such as disparate atomic clocks.

Their underlying geometry is non-Euclidean, and the absence of Bloch\&$\#$39;s theorem precludes a simple understanding of their band structure. Motivated by recent insights into hyperbolic band theory, we initiate a crystallography of hyperbolic lattices. We show that many hyperbolic lattices feature a hidden crystal structure characterized by unit cells, hyperbolic Bravais lattices, and associated symmetry groups. Using the mathematical framework of higher-genus Riemann surfaces and Fuchsian groups, we derive, for the first time, a list of example hyperbolic {p,q} lattices and their hyperbolic Bravais lattices, including five infinite families and several graphs relevant for experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics and topolectrical circuits. Our results find application for both finite and infinite hyperbolic lattices. We describe a method to efficiently generate finite hyperbolic lattices of arbitrary size and explain why the present crystallography is the first step towards a complete band theory of hyperbolic lattices and apply it to construct Bloch wave Hamiltonians.

This is in contrast to previous works that use machine learning to classify different phases of matter, but do not reveal the nature of the critical point between phases. Given that the ground-state entanglement Hamiltonian of certain topological phases of matter is also described by conformal field theories, we use supervised learning on R{\'e}yni entropies and find that the machine is able to identify which conformal field theory describes the entanglement Hamiltonian with only the lowest few R{\'e}yni entropies to a high degree of accuracy. Finally, using autoencoders, an unsupervised learning algorithm, we find a hidden variable that has a direct correlation with the central charge and discuss prospects for using machine learning to investigate other conformal field theories, including higher-dimensional ones. Our results highlight that machine learning can be used to find and characterize critical points and also hint at the intriguing possibility to use machine learning to learn about more complex conformal field theories.</p>},

Here, we devise a device-independent spot-checking protocol which uses only uniform bits as input. Implemented with a photonic loophole-free Bell test, we can produce 24\% more certified output bits (1,181,264,237) than consumed input bits (953,301,640), which is 5 orders of magnitude more efficient than our previous work [arXiv:1812.07786].

	abstract = {<p>Simulating and predicting dynamics of quantum many-body systems is extremely challenging, even for state-of-the-art computational methods, due to the spread of entanglement across the system. However, in the long-wavelength limit, quantum systems often admit a simplified description, which involves a small set of physical observables and requires only a few parameters such as sound velocity or viscosity. Unveiling the relationship between these hydrodynamic equations and the underlying microscopic theory usually requires a great effort by condensed matter theorists. In the present paper, we develop a new machine-learning framework for automated discovery of effective equations from a limited set of available data, thus bypassing complicated analytical derivations. The data can be generated from numerical simulations or come from experimental quantum simulator platforms. Using integrable models, where direct comparisons can be made, we reproduce previously known hydrodynamic equations, strikingly discover novel equations and provide their derivation whenever possible. We discover new hydrodynamic equations describing dynamics of interacting systems, for which the derivation remains an outstanding challenge.

Unfortunately, it is often impossible to obtain such estimates directly, as the computer is restricted to measuring in a fixed computational basis. One common solution splits the observable into a weighted sum of Pauli operators and measures each separately, at the cost of many measurements. An improved version first groups mutually commuting Pauli operators together and then measures all operators within each group simultaneously. The effectiveness of this depends on two factors. First, to enable simultaneous measurement, circuits are required to rotate each group to the computational basis. In our work, we present two efficient circuit constructions that suitably rotate any group of k commuting n-qubit Pauli operators using at most kn\&minus;k(k+1)/2 and O(kn/logk) two-qubit gates respectively. Second, metrics that justifiably measure the effectiveness of a grouping are required. In our work, we propose two natural metrics that operate under the assumption that measurements are distributed optimally among groups. Motivated by our new metrics, we introduce SORTED INSERTION, a grouping strategy that is explicitly aware of the weighting of each Pauli operator in the observable. Our methods are numerically illustrated in the context of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, where the observables in question are molecular Hamiltonians. As measured by our metrics, SORTED INSERTION outperforms four conventional greedy colouring algorithms that seek the minimum number of groups.</p>},

We show that, as one increases the rate of post-selection, this non-Hermitian Hamiltonian undergoes a spectral phase transition. On one side of this phase transition (for weak post-selection) an initially mixed density matrix remains mixed at all times, and an initially unentangled state develops volume-law entanglement; on the other side, an arbitrary initial state approaches a unique pure state with low entanglement. We identify this transition with an exceptional point in the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, at which PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. We characterize the transition as well as the nontrivial steady state that emerges at late times in the mixed phase using exact diagonalization and an approximate, analytically tractable mean-field theory; these methods yield consistent conclusions.</p>},

	month = {1/2/2021},
	abstract = {<p>Unitary circuits subject to repeated projective measurements can undergo an entanglement phase transition (EPT) as a function of the measurement rate. This transition is generally understood in terms of a competition between the scrambling effects of unitary dynamics and the disentangling effects of measurements. We find that, surprisingly, EPTs are possible even in the absence of scrambling unitary dynamics, where they are best understood as arising from measurements alone. This motivates us to introduce \emph{measurement-only models}, in which the \&quot;scrambling\&quot; and \&quot;un-scrambling\&quot; effects driving the EPT are fundamentally intertwined and cannot be attributed to physically distinct processes. This represents a novel form of an EPT, conceptually distinct from that in hybrid unitary-projective circuits. We explore the entanglement phase diagrams, critical points, and quantum code properties of some of these measurement-only models. We find that the principle driving the EPTs in these models is \emph{frustration}, or mutual incompatibility, of the measurements. Suprisingly, an entangling (volume-law) phase is the generic outcome when measuring sufficiently long but still local (≳3-body) operators. We identify a class of exceptions to this behavior (\&quot;bipartite ensembles\&quot;) which cannot sustain an entangling phase, but display dual area-law phases, possibly with different kinds of quantum order, separated by self-dual critical points. Finally, we introduce a measure of information spreading in dynamics with measurements and use it to demonstrate the emergence of a statistical light-cone, despite the non-locality inherent to quantum measurements.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The performance of a quantum information processing protocol is ultimately judged by distinguishability measures that quantify how distinguishable the actual result of the protocol is from the ideal case. The most prominent distinguishability measures are those based on the fidelity and trace distance, due to their physical interpretations. In this paper, we propose and review several algorithms for estimating distinguishability measures based on trace distance and fidelity, and we evaluate their performance using simulators of quantum computers. The algorithms can be used for distinguishing quantum states, channels, and strategies (the last also known in the literature as \&quot;quantum combs\&quot;). The fidelity-based algorithms offer novel physical interpretations of these distinguishability measures in terms of the maximum probability with which a single prover (or competing provers) can convince a verifier to accept the outcome of an associated computation. We simulate these algorithms by using a variational approach with parameterized quantum circuits and find that they converge well for the examples that we consider.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum computing can efficiently simulate Hamiltonian dynamics of many-body quantum physics, a task that is generally intractable with classical computers. The hardness lies at the ubiquitous anti-commutative relations of quantum operators, in corresponding with the notorious negative sign problem in classical simulation. Intuitively, Hamiltonians with more commutative terms are also easier to simulate on a quantum computer, and anti-commutative relations generally cause more errors, such as in the product formula method. Here, we theoretically explore the role of anti-commutative relation in Hamiltonian simulation. We find that, contrary to our intuition, anti-commutative relations could also reduce the hardness of Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically, Hamiltonians with mutually anti-commutative terms are easy to simulate, as what happens with ones consisting of mutually commutative terms. Such a property is further utilized to reduce the algorithmic error or the gate complexity in the truncated Taylor series quantum algorithm for general problems. Moreover, we propose two modified linear combinations of unitaries methods tailored for Hamiltonians with different degrees of anti-commutation. We numerically verify that the proposed methods exploiting anti-commutative relations could significantly improve the simulation accuracy of electronic Hamiltonians. Our work sheds light on the roles of commutative and anti-commutative relations in simulating quantum systems.</p>},

We conduct a quantitative investigation on the landscape of loss functions of QNNs and identify a class of simple yet extremely hard QNN instances for training. Specifically, we show for typical under-parameterized QNNs, there exists a dataset that induces a loss function with the number of spurious local minima depending exponentially on the number of parameters. Moreover, we show the optimality of our construction by providing an almost matching upper bound on such dependence. While local minima in classical neural networks are due to non-linear activations, in quantum neural networks local minima appear as a result of the quantum interference phenomenon. Finally, we empirically confirm that our constructions can indeed be hard instances in practice with typical gradient-based optimizers, which demonstrates the practical value of our findings.\&nbsp;</p>},

We show that by introducing quantum gates implementing unitary transformations generated by the symmetries of the system, one can induce destructive interference between the errors from different steps of the simulation, effectively giving faster quantum simulation by symmetry protection. We derive rigorous bounds on the error of a symmetry-protected simulation algorithm and identify conditions for optimal symmetry protection. In particular, when the symmetry transformations are chosen as powers of a unitary, the error of the algorithm is approximately projected to the so-called quantum Zeno subspaces. We prove a bound on this approximation error, exponentially improving a recent result of Burgarth, Facchi, Gramegna, and Pascazio. We apply our technique to the simulations of the XXZ Heisenberg interactions with local disorder and the Schwinger model in quantum field theory. For both systems, our algorithm can reduce the simulation error by several orders of magnitude over the unprotected simulation. Finally, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that our technique can also protect simulation against other types of coherent, temporally correlated errors, such as the 1/f noise commonly found in solid-state experiments.</p>},

Using a combination of numerical and analytical methods, we show that the elastic response becomes increasingly weak at the effective spin frequency, showing instead an increasingly strong and broadband response at higher energies. We also show that the photons can decay into multiple photons of smaller energies. The total probability of these inelastic processes can be as large as the total elastic scattering rate, or half of the total scattering rate, which is as large as it can be. The frustrated spin induces strong anisotropic photon-photon interactions that are dominated by inter-species interactions.

One way to bridge the gap between verifiability and implementation is to use \&quot;interactions\&quot; between a prover and a verifier.

	abstract = {<p>There is currently a large interest in understanding the potential advantages quantum devices can offer for probabilistic modelling. In this work we investigate, within two different oracle models, the probably approximately correct (PAC) learnability of quantum circuit Born machines, i.e., the output distributions of local quantum circuits. We first show a negative result, namely, that the output distributions of super-logarithmic depth Clifford circuits are not sample-efficiently learnable in the statistical query model, i.e., when given query access to empirical expectation values of bounded functions over the sample space. This immediately implies the hardness, for both quantum and classical algorithms, of learning from statistical queries the output distributions of local quantum circuits using any gate set which includes the Clifford group. As many practical generative modelling algorithms use statistical queries -- including those for training quantum circuit Born machines -- our result is broadly applicable and strongly limits the possibility of a meaningful quantum advantage for learning the output distributions of local quantum circuits. As a positive result, we show that in a more powerful oracle model, namely when directly given access to samples, the output distributions of local Clifford circuits are computationally efficiently PAC learnable by a classical learner.

	abstract = {<p>Monte Carlo simulations are often useful tools for modeling quantum systems, but in some cases they suffer from a sign problem, which manifests as an oscillating phase attached to the probabilities being sampled. This sign problem generally leads to an exponential slow down in the time taken by a Monte Carlo algorithm to reach any given level of accuracy, and it has been shown that completely solving the sign problem for an arbitrary quantum system is NP-hard. However, a variety of techniques exist for mitigating the sign problem in specific cases; in particular, the technique of deforming the Monte Carlo simulation\&$\#$39;s plane of integration onto Lefschetz thimbles (that is, complex hypersurfaces of stationary phase) has seen success for many problems of interest in the context of quantum field theories. We extend this methodology to discrete spin systems by utilizing spin coherent state path integrals to re-express the spin system\&$\#$39;s partition function in terms of continuous variables. This translation to continuous variables introduces additional challenges into the Lefschetz thimble method, which we address. We show that these techniques do indeed work to lessen the sign problem on some simple spin systems.</p>},

We map this system to a classical facilitated hopping model that is computationally tractable for large system sizes, and investigate its dynamics. The classical model exhibits a robust crossover between an ergodic (thermal) phase and a frozen (localized) phase. The frozen phase is destabilized by thermal subregions (bubbles), which thermalize surrounding sites by providing a fluctuating interaction energy and so enable off-resonance particle transport. Investigating steady state transport, we observe that the interplay between thermal and frozen bubbles leads to a clear transition between diffusive and subdiffusive regimes. This phenomenology both describes the MBL system coupled to a bath, and provides a classical analogue for the many-body localization transition in the corresponding quantum model, in that the classical model displays long local memory times. It also highlights the importance of the details of the bath coupling in studies of MBL systems coupled to thermal environments.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>It is interesting to observe that all optical materials with a positive refractive index have a value of index that is of order unity. Surprisingly, though, a deep understanding of the mechanisms that lead to this universal behavior seems to be lacking. Moreover, this observation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that a single, isolated atom is known to have a giant optical response, as characterized by a resonant scattering cross section that far exceeds its physical size. Here, we theoretically and numerically investigate the evolution of the optical properties of an ensemble of ideal atoms as a function of density, starting from the dilute gas limit, including the effects of multiple scattering and near-field interactions. Interestingly, despite the giant response of an isolated atom, we find that the maximum index does not indefinitely grow with increasing density, but rather reaches a limiting value n\&asymp;1.7. We propose an explanation based upon strong-disorder renormalization group theory, in which the near-field interaction combined with random atomic positions results in an inhomogeneous broadening of atomic resonance frequencies. This mechanism ensures that regardless of the physical atomic density, light at any given frequency only interacts with at most a few near-resonant atoms per cubic wavelength, thus limiting the maximum index attainable. Our work is a promising first step to understand the limits of refractive index from a bottom-up, atomic physics perspective, and also introduces renormalization group as a powerful tool to understand the generally complex problem of multiple scattering of light overall.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>When two spatially separated parties make measurements on an unknown entangled quantum state, what correlations can they achieve? How difficult is it to determine whether a given correlation is a quantum correlation? These questions are central to problems in quantum communication and computation. Previous work has shown that the general membership problem for quantum correlations is computationally undecidable. In the current work we show something stronger: there is a family of constant-sized correlations -- that is, correlations for which the number of measurements and number of measurement outcomes are fixed -- such that solving the quantum membership problem for this family is computationally impossible. Thus, the undecidability that arises in understanding Bell experiments is not dependent on varying the number of measurements in the experiment. This places strong constraints on the types of descriptions that can be given for quantum correlation sets. Our proof is based on a combination of techniques from quantum self-testing and from undecidability results of the third author for linear system nonlocal games.</p>},

We rigorously prove a serious limitation for noisy VQAs, in that the noise causes the training landscape to have a barren plateau (i.e., vanishing gradient). Specifically, for the local Pauli noise considered, we prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits n if the depth of the ansatz grows linearly with n. These noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs) are conceptually different from noise-free barren plateaus, which are linked to random parameter initialization. Our result is formulated for a generic ansatz that includes as special cases the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz, among others.

It was recently shown by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright and Yuen that deciding whether the (finite-dimensional) quantum value of a nonlocal game is 1 or at most 12 is complete for the class Σ1 (i.e., RE). A result of Slofstra implies that deciding whether the commuting operator value of a nonlocal game is equal to 1 is complete for the class Π1 (i.e., coRE). We prove that deciding whether the quantum value of a two-player nonlocal game is exactly equal to 1 is complete for Π2; this class is in the second level of the arithmetical hierarchy and corresponds to formulas of the form \&quot;\&forall;x\&exist;yϕ(x,y)\&quot;. This shows that exactly computing the quantum value is strictly harder than approximating it, and also strictly harder than computing the commuting operator value (either exactly or approximately). We explain how results about the complexity of nonlocal games all follow in a unified manner from a technique known as compression. At the core of our Π2-completeness result is a new \&quot;gapless\&quot; compression theorem that holds for both quantum and commuting operator strategies. Our compression theorem yields as a byproduct an alternative proof of Slofstra\&$\#$39;s result that the set of quantum correlations is not closed.

Extensions to non-equilibrium systems have led to surprising insights into the nature of many-body thermalization and the discovery of novel phases of matter, often catalyzed by driving the system periodically. The inherent heating from such Floquet drives can be tempered by including strong disorder in the system, but this can also mask the generality of non-equilibrium phases. In this work, we utilize a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe signatures of a non-equilibrium driven phase without disorder: the prethermal discrete time crystal (PDTC). Here, many-body heating is suppressed not by disorder-induced many-body localization, but instead via high-frequency driving, leading to an expansive time window where non-equilibrium phases can emerge. We observe a number of key features that distinguish the PDTC from its many-body-localized disordered counterpart, such as the drive-frequency control of its lifetime and the dependence of time-crystalline order on the energy density of the initial state. Floquet prethermalization is thus presented as a general strategy for creating, stabilizing and studying intrinsically out-of-equilibrium phases of matter.</p>},

However, the most efficient of those procedures is still asymptotically sub-optimal by a factor of log(κ). Here, we prove a rigorous form of the adiabatic theorem that bounds the error in terms of the spectral gap for intrinsically discrete time evolutions. We use this discrete adiabatic theorem to develop a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems that is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that the complexity is strictly linear in κ, matching a known lower bound on the complexity. Our O(κlog(1/ε)) complexity is also optimal in terms of the combined scaling in κ and the precision ε. Compared to existing suboptimal methods, our algorithm is simpler and easier to implement.

A less-explored alternative approach is to repeatedly apply a quantum channel with a desired quantum state as a stable fixed point. Increased circuit depth can in this case be beneficial rather than harmful due to dissipative self-correction. The quantum channels constructed from MERA circuits can be interpreted in terms of the renormalization group(RG), and their fixed points are RG fixed points, i.e. scale-invariant systems such as conformal field theories. Here, building upon the theoretical proposal of Kim and Swingle, we numerically and experimentally study the robust preparation of the ground state of the critical Ising model using circuits adapted from the work of Evenbly and White. The experimental implementation exhibits self-correction through renormalization seen in the convergence and stability of local observables, and makes essential use of the ability to measure and reset individual qubits afforded by the \&quot;quantum CCD\&quot; architecture of the Honeywell ion-trap.

	abstract = {<p>We consider the problem of estimating multiple analytic functions of a set of local parameters via qubit sensors in a quantum sensor network. To address this problem, we highlight a generalization of the sensor symmetric performance bounds of Rubio et. al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53 344001 (2020)] and develop a new optimized sequential protocol for measuring such functions. We compare the performance of both approaches to one another and to local protocols that do not utilize quantum entanglement, emphasizing the geometric significance of the coefficient vectors of the measured functions in determining the best choice of measurement protocol. We show that, in many cases, especially for a large number of sensors, the optimized sequential protocol results in more accurate measurements than the other strategies. In addition, in contrast to the the sensor symmetric approach, the sequential protocol is known to always be explicitly implementable. The sequential protocol is very general and has a wide range of metrological applications.</p>},

Compared to the classical state-of-the-art algorithm by Jin et al. with O~(log6n/ϵ1.75) queries to the gradient oracle (i.e., the first-order oracle), our quantum algorithm is polynomially better in terms of n and matches its complexity in terms of 1/ϵ. Our quantum algorithm is built upon two techniques: First, we replace the classical perturbations in gradient descent methods by simulating quantum wave equations, which constitutes the polynomial speedup in n for escaping from saddle points. Second, we show how to use a quantum gradient computation algorithm due to Jordan to replace the classical gradient queries by quantum evaluation queries with the same complexity. Finally, we also perform numerical experiments that support our quantum speedup.</p>},

For such an MDP, we design quantum algorithms that approximate an optimal policy (π\&lowast;), the optimal value function (v\&lowast;), and the optimal Q-function (q\&lowast;), assuming the algorithms can access samples from the environment in quantum superposition. This assumption is justified whenever there exists a simulator for the environment; for example, if the environment is a video game or some other program. Our quantum algorithms, inspired by value iteration, achieve quadratic speedups over the best-possible classical sample complexities in the approximation accuracy (ϵ) and two main parameters of the MDP: the effective time horizon (11\&minus;γ) and the size of the action space (A). Moreover, we show that our quantum algorithm for computing q\&lowast; is optimal by proving a matching quantum lower bound.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Photonics is a promising platform for demonstrating quantum computational supremacy (QCS) by convincingly outperforming the most powerful classical supercomputers on a well-defined computational task. Despite this promise, existing photonics proposals and demonstrations face significant hurdles. Experimentally, current implementations of Gaussian boson sampling lack programmability or have prohibitive loss rates. Theoretically, there is a comparative lack of rigorous evidence for the classical hardness of GBS. In this work, we make significant progress in improving both the theoretical evidence and experimental prospects. On the theory side, we provide strong evidence for the hardness of Gaussian boson sampling, placing it on par with the strongest theoretical proposals for QCS. On the experimental side, we propose a new QCS architecture, high-dimensional Gaussian boson sampling, which is programmable and can be implemented with low loss rates using few optical components. We show that particular classical algorithms for simulating GBS are vastly outperformed by high-dimensional Gaussian boson sampling experiments at modest system sizes. This work thus opens the path to demonstrating QCS with programmable photonic processors.</p>},

A central problem in the study of lattices is that of finding the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice. Asymptotically, sieving is the best known technique for solving the shortest vector problem, however, sieving requires memory exponential in the dimension of the lattice. As a consequence, enumeration algorithms are often used in place of sieving due to their linear memory complexity, despite their super-exponential runtime. In this work, we present a heuristic quantum sieving algorithm that has memory complexity polynomial in the size of the length of the sampled vectors at the initial step of the sieve. In other words, unlike most sieving algorithms, the memory complexity of our algorithm does not depend on the number of sampled vectors at the initial step of the sieve.</p>},

It is a fascinating problem in complexity theory---its hardness is mysterious, and a better understanding of its hardness can have surprising implications to many fields in computer science.<br />We first define and investigate the basic complexity-theoretic properties of minimum quantum circuit size problems for three natural objects: Boolean functions, unitaries, and quantum states. We show that these problems are not trivially in NP but in QCMA (or have QCMA protocols). Next, we explore the relations between the three quantum MCSPs and their variants. We discover that some reductions that are not known for classical MCSP exist for quantum MCSPs for unitaries and states, e.g., search-to-decision reduction and self-reduction. Finally, we systematically generalize results known for classical MCSP to the quantum setting (including quantum cryptography, quantum learning theory, quantum circuit lower bounds, and quantum fine-grained complexity) and also find new connections to tomography and quantum gravity. Due to the fundamental differences between classical and quantum circuits, most of our results require extra care and reveal properties and phenomena unique to the quantum setting. Our findings could be of interest for future studies, and we post several open problems for further exploration along this direction.</p>},

In this work, we develop a generic construction that embeds a new class of QMBS, rainbow scars, into the spectrum of an arbitrary Hamiltonian. Unlike other examples of QMBS, rainbow scars display extensive bipartite entanglement entropy while retaining a simple entanglement structure. Specifically, the entanglement scaling is volume-law for a random bipartition, while scaling for a fine-tuned bipartition is sub-extensive. When internal symmetries are present, the construction leads to multiple, and even towers of rainbow scars revealed through distinctive non-thermal dynamics. To this end, we provide an experimental road map for realizing rainbow scar states in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, leading to coherent oscillations distinct from the strictly sub-volume-law QMBS previously realized in the same system.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum dots (QDs) defined with electrostatic gates are a leading platform for a scalable quantum computing implementation. However, with increasing numbers of qubits, the complexity of the control parameter space also grows. Traditional measurement techniques, relying on complete or near-complete exploration via two-parameter scans (images) of the device response, quickly become impractical with increasing numbers of gates. Here, we propose to circumvent this challenge by introducing a measurement technique relying on one-dimensional projections of the device response in the multi-dimensional parameter space. Dubbed as the ray-based classification (RBC) framework, we use this machine learning (ML) approach to implement a classifier for QD states, enabling automated recognition of qubit-relevant parameter regimes. We show that RBC surpasses the 82 \% accuracy benchmark from the experimental implementation of image-based classification techniques from prior work while cutting down the number of measurement points needed by up to 70 \%. The reduction in measurement cost is a significant gain for time-intensive QD measurements and is a step forward towards the scalability of these devices. We also discuss how the RBC-based optimizer, which tunes the device to a multi-qubit regime, performs when tuning in the two- and three-dimensional parameter spaces defined by plunger and barrier gates that control the dots. This work provides experimental validation of both efficient state identification and optimization with ML techniques for non-traditional measurements in quantum systems with high-dimensional parameter spaces and time-intensive measurements.</p>},

We find evidence for this coincidence when the initial conditions are sufficiently generic, or typical. We quantify this with the effective dimension of the state and with a state-observable effective dimension, which estimate the number of energy levels that participate in the dynamics. Our findings are confirmed by proving that these different timescales coincide for dynamics generated by Haar-random Hamiltonians. This also allows to quantitatively understand the scope of previous theoretical results on equilibration timescales and on random matrix formalisms. We approach this problem with exact, full spectrum diagonalization.

	abstract = {<p>The ability to simulate a fermionic system on a quantum computer is expected to revolutionize chemical engineering, materials design, nuclear physics, to name a few. Thus, optimizing the simulation circuits is of significance in harnessing the power of quantum computers. Here, we address this problem in two aspects. In the fault-tolerant regime, we optimize the $\rzgate$ and $\tgate$ gate counts along with the ancilla qubit counts required, assuming the use of a product-formula algorithm for implementation. We obtain a savings ratio of two in the gate counts and a savings ratio of eleven in the number of ancilla qubits required over the state of the art. In the pre-fault tolerant regime, we optimize the two-qubit gate counts, assuming the use of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach. Specific to the latter, we present a framework that enables bootstrapping the VQE progression towards the convergence of the ground-state energy of the fermionic system. This framework, based on perturbation theory, is capable of improving the energy estimate at each cycle of the VQE progression, by about a factor of three closer to the known ground-state energy compared to the standard VQE approach in the test-bed, classically-accessible system of the water molecule. The improved energy estimate in turn results in a commensurate level of savings of quantum resources, such as the number of qubits and quantum gates, required to be within a pre-specified tolerance from the known ground-state energy. We also explore a suite of generalized transformations of fermion to qubit operators and show that resource-requirement savings of up to more than 20\% is possible.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>\&quot;Pay-per-last-N-shares\&quot; (PPLNS) is one of the most common payout strategies used by mining pools in Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies. As with any payment scheme, it is imperative to study issues of incentive compatibility of miners within the pool. For PPLNS this question has only been partially answered; we know that reasonably-sized miners within a PPLNS pool prefer following the pool protocol over employing specific deviations. In this paper, we present a novel modification to PPLNS where we randomise the protocol in a natural way. We call our protocol \&quot;Randomised pay-per-last-N-shares\&quot; (RPPLNS), and note that the randomised structure of the protocol greatly simplifies the study of its incentive compatibility. We show that RPPLNS maintains the strengths of PPLNS (i.e., fairness, variance reduction, and resistance to pool hopping), while also being robust against a richer class of strategic mining than what has been shown for PPLNS.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Dissipative systems can often exhibit wavelength-dependent loss rates. One prominent example is Rydberg polaritons formed by electromagnetically-induced transparency, which have long been a leading candidate for studying the physics of interacting photons and also hold promise as a platform for quantum information. In this system, dissipation is in the form of quantum diffusion, i.e., proportional to k2 (k being the wavevector) and vanishing at long wavelengths as k\&rarr;0. Here, we show that one-dimensional condensates subject to this type of loss are unstable to long-wavelength density fluctuations in an unusual manner: after a prolonged period in which the condensate appears to relax to a uniform state, local depleted regions quickly form and spread ballistically throughout the system. We connect this behavior to the leading-order equation for the nearly-uniform condensate -- a dispersive analogue to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation -- which develops singularities in finite time. Furthermore, we show that the wavefronts of the depleted regions are described by purely dissipative solitons within a pair of hydrodynamic equations, with no counterpart in lossless condensates. We close by discussing conditions under which such singularities and the resulting solitons can be physically realized.</p>},

Underpinning their established understanding is the quantum Ising spin chain, which can be recast as a fermionic model or viewed as a standalone effective theory for the surface-code edge -- both of which harbor non-Abelian defects. We generalize these notions by deriving an effective Ising-like spin chain describing the edge of quantum-double topological order. Relating Majorana and parafermion modes to anyonic strings, we introduce quantum-double generalizations of non-Abelian defects. We develop a way to embed finite-group valued qunits into those valued in continuous groups. Using this embedding, we provide a continuum description of the spin chain and recast its non-interacting part as a quantum wire via addition of a Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten term and non-Abelian bosonization.</p>},

In the limit of infinite anisotropy, transport is subdiffusive at all times; for large finite anisotropy, one eventually recovers diffusion at late times, but with a diffusion constant independent of the strength of the integrability breaking perturbation. We provide numerical evidence for these findings, and explain them by adapting the generalized hydrodynamics framework to nearly integrable dynamics. Our results show that the diffusion constant of near-integrable interacting spin chains is not generically a continuous function of the integrability-breaking parameter.\&nbsp;</p>},

We target surface codes, which form a 2D grid of logical qubits with nearest-neighbor logical operations. Embedding an input circuit\&$\#$39;s qubits in surface codes can result in long-range two-qubit operations across the grid. We show how to prepare many long-range Bell pairs on qubits connected by edge-disjoint paths of ancillas in constant depth which can be used to perform these long-range operations. This forms one core part of our Edge-Disjoint Paths Compilation (EDPC) algorithm, by easily performing parallel long-range Clifford operations in constant depth. It also allows us to establish a connection between surface code compilation and several well-studied edge-disjoint paths problems. Similar techniques allow us to perform non-Clifford single-qubit rotations far from magic state distillation factories. In this case, we can easily find the maximum set of paths by a max-flow reduction, which forms the other major part of our EDPC algorithm. We compare EDPC to other compilation approaches including a SWAP-based algorithm, and find significantly improved performance for circuits built from parallel CNOTs, and for circuits which implement the multi-controlled X gate.</p>},

Thus, the optimal strategy for a synchronous game need not be synchronous. We derive a formula for the synchronous value of an XOR game as an optimization problem over a spectrahedron involving a matrix related to the cost matrix. We give an example of a game such that the synchronous value of repeated products of the game is strictly increasing. We show that the synchronous quantum bias of the XOR of two XOR games is not multiplicative.

	abstract = {<p>The Lie-Trotter formula, together with its higher-order generalizations, provides a direct approach to decomposing the exponential of a sum of operators. Despite significant effort, the error scaling of such product formulas remains poorly understood. We develop a theory of Trotter error that overcomes the limitations of prior approaches based on truncating the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. Our analysis directly exploits the commutativity of operator summands, producing tighter error bounds for both real- and imaginary-time evolutions. Whereas previous work achieves similar goals for systems with geometric locality or Lie-algebraic structure, our approach holds in general. We give a host of improved algorithms for digital quantum simulation and quantum Monte Carlo methods, including simulations of second-quantized plane-wave electronic structure, k-local Hamiltonians, rapidly decaying power-law interactions, clustered Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model, and quantum ferromagnets, nearly matching or even outperforming the best previous results. We obtain further speedups using the fact that product formulas can preserve the locality of the simulated system. Specifically, we show that local observables can be simulated with complexity independent of the system size for power-law interacting systems, which implies a Lieb-Robinson bound as a byproduct. Our analysis reproduces known tight bounds for first- and second-order formulas. Our higher-order bound overestimates the complexity of simulating a one-dimensional Heisenberg model with an even-odd ordering of terms by only a factor of 5, and is close to tight for power-law interactions and other orderings of terms. This suggests that our theory can accurately characterize Trotter error in terms of both asymptotic scaling and constant prefactor.</p>},

We uncover blocking challenges in known approaches and introduce a new method for quantum derivative pricing - the re-parameterization method - that avoids them. This method combines pre-trained variational circuits with fault-tolerant quantum computing to dramatically reduce resource requirements. We find that the benchmark use cases we examine require 7.5k logical qubits and a T-depth of 46 million and thus estimate that quantum advantage would require a logical clock speed of 10Mhz.

These fixed points and the field theories are directly relevant for the long-wavelength physics of certain interacting Dirac systems, such as repulsive spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice or π-flux square lattice. The torus energy spectrum has been shown previously to serve as a characteristic fingerprint of relativistic fixed points and is a powerful tool to discriminate quantum critical behaviour in numerical simulations. Here, we use a combination of exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo simulations of strongly interacting fermionic lattice models, to compute the critical torus energy spectrum on finite-size clusters with periodic boundaries and extrapolate them to the thermodynamic limit. Additionally, we compute the torus energy spectrum analytically using the perturbative expansion in ε=4\&minus;D, which is in good agreement with the numerical results, thereby validating the presence of the chiral Ising fixed point in the lattice models at hand. We show that the strong interaction between the spinor field and the scalar order-parameter field strongly influences the critical torus energy spectrum and we observe prominent multiplicity features related to an emergent symmetry predicted from the quantum field theory. Building on these results we are able to address the subtle crossover physics of the low-energy spectrum flowing from the chiral Ising fixed point to the Dirac fixed point, and analyze earlier flawed attempts to extract Fermi velocity renormalizations from the low-energy spectrum.</p>},

OQASM\&$\#$39;s design enabled us to prove correct VQO\&$\#$39;s compilers -- from a simple imperative language called OQIMP to OQASM, and from OQASM to SQIR, a general-purpose quantum assembly language -- and allowed us to efficiently test properties of OQASM programs using the QuickChick property-based testing framework. We have used VQO to implement oracles used in Shor\&$\#$39;s and Grover\&$\#$39;s algorithms, as well as several common arithmetic operators. VQO\&$\#$39;s oracles have performance comparable to those produced by Quipper, a state-of-the-art but unverified quantum programming platform.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Scrambling, a process in which quantum information spreads over a complex quantum system becoming inaccessible to simple probes, happens in generic chaotic quantum many-body systems, ranging from spin chains, to metals, even to black holes. Scrambling can be measured using out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), which are closely tied to the growth of Heisenberg operators. In this work, we present a general method to calculate OTOCs of local operators in local one-dimensional systems based on approximating Heisenberg operators as matrix-product operators (MPOs). Contrary to the common belief that such tensor network methods work only at early times, we show that the entire early growth region of the OTOC can be captured using an MPO approximation with modest bond dimension. We analytically establish the goodness of the approximation by showing that if an appropriate OTOC is close to its initial value, then the associated Heisenberg operator has low entanglement across a given cut. We use the method to study scrambling in a chaotic spin chain with 201 sites. Based on this data and OTOC results for black holes, local random circuit models, and non-interacting systems, we conjecture a universal form for the dynamics of the OTOC near the wavefront. We show that this form collapses the chaotic spin chain data over more than fifteen orders of magnitude.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Local tensor methods are a class of optimization algorithms that was introduced in [Hastings,arXiv:1905.07047v2][1] as a classical analogue of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). These algorithms treat the cost function as a Hamiltonian on spin degrees of freedom and simulate the relaxation of the system to a low energy configuration using local update rules on the spins. Whereas the emphasis in [1] was on theoretical worst-case analysis, we here investigate performance in practice through benchmarking experiments on instances of the MAXCUT problem.Through heuristic arguments we propose formulas for choosing the hyperparameters of the algorithm which are found to be in good agreement with the optimal choices determined from experiment. We observe that the local tensor method is closely related to gradient descent on a relaxation of maxcut to continuous variables, but consistently outperforms gradient descent in all instances tested. We find time to solution achieved by the local tensor method is highly uncorrelated with that achieved by a widely used commercial optimization package; on some MAXCUT instances the local tensor method beats the commercial solver in time to solution by up to two orders of magnitude and vice-versa. Finally, we argue that the local tensor method closely follows discretized, imaginary-time dynamics of the system under the problem Hamiltonian.</p>},

In this paper we show how to obtain approximate QFT with the t-count of O(n log(n)).

This is achieved by using strong microwave fields to dress nearby Rydberg states, leading to asymmetric blockade in which control-target interactions are much stronger than control-control and target-target interactions. The implementation of these multi-qubit gates can drastically simplify both quantum algorithms and state preparation. To illustrate this, we show that a 25-atom GHZ state can be created using only three gates with an error of 7.8\%.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Deep learning models have been criticized for their lack of easy interpretation, which undermines confidence in their use for important applications. Nevertheless, they are consistently utilized in many applications, consequential to humans\&$\#$39; lives, mostly because of their better performance. Therefore, there is a great need for computational methods that can explain, audit, and debug such models. Here, we use flip points to accomplish these goals for deep learning models with continuous output scores (e.g., computed by softmax), used in social applications. A flip point is any point that lies on the boundary between two output classes: e.g. for a model with a binary yes/no output, a flip point is any input that generates equal scores for \&quot;yes\&quot; and \&quot;no\&quot;. The flip point closest to a given input is of particular importance because it reveals the least changes in the input that would change a model\&$\#$39;s classification, and we show that it is the solution to a well-posed optimization problem. Flip points also enable us to systematically study the decision boundaries of a deep learning classifier. The resulting insight into the decision boundaries of a deep model can clearly explain the model\&$\#$39;s output on the individual-level, via an explanation report that is understandable by non-experts. We also develop a procedure to understand and audit model behavior towards groups of people. Flip points can also be used to alter the decision boundaries in order to improve undesirable behaviors. We demonstrate our methods by investigating several models trained on standard datasets used in social applications of machine learning. We also identify the features that are most responsible for particular classifications and misclassifications.</p>},

Electrons confined in arrays of semiconductor nanostructures, called quantum dots (QDs), is one such approach. The easy access to control parameters, fast measurements, long qubit lifetimes, and the potential for scalability make QDs especially attractive. However, as the size of the QD array grows, so does the number of parameters needed for control and thus the tuning complexity. The current practice of manually tuning the qubits is a relatively time-consuming procedure and is inherently impractical for scaling up and applications. In this work, we report on the in situ implementation of an auto-tuning protocol proposed by Kalantre et al. [arXiv:1712.04914]. In particular, we discuss how to establish a seamless communication protocol between a machine learning (ML)-based auto-tuner and the experimental apparatus. We then show that a ML algorithm trained exclusively on synthetic data coming from a physical model to quantitatively classify the state of the QD device, combined with an optimization routine, can be used to replace manual tuning of gate voltages in devices. A success rate of over 85 \% is determined for tuning to a double quantum dot regime when at least one of the plunger gates is initiated sufficiently close to the desired state. Modifications to the training network, fitness function, and optimizer are discussed as a path towards further improvement in the success rate when starting both near and far detuned from the target double dot range.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>In a recent seminal work, Bitansky and Shmueli (STOC \&$\#$39;20) gave the first construction of a constant round zero-knowledge argument for NP secure against quantum attacks. However, their construction has several drawbacks compared to the classical counterparts. Specifically, their construction only achieves computational soundness, requires strong assumptions of quantum hardness of learning with errors (QLWE assumption) and the existence of quantum fully homomorphic encryption (QFHE), and relies on non-black-box simulation. In this paper, we resolve these issues at the cost of weakening the notion of zero-knowledge to what is called ε-zero-knowledge. Concretely, we construct the following protocols: - We construct a constant round interactive proof for NP that satisfies statistical soundness and black-box ε-zero-knowledge against quantum attacks assuming the existence of collapsing hash functions, which is a quantum counterpart of collision-resistant hash functions. Interestingly, this construction is just an adapted version of the classical protocol by Goldreich and Kahan (JoC \&$\#$39;96) though the proof of ε-zero-knowledge property against quantum adversaries requires novel ideas. - We construct a constant round interactive argument for NP that satisfies computational soundness and black-box ε-zero-knowledge against quantum attacks only assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions. At the heart of our results is a new quantum rewinding technique that enables a simulator to extract a committed message of a malicious verifier while simulating verifier\&$\#$39;s internal state in an appropriate sense.</p>},

In the case where a well-defined bulk geometry exists, we explicitly reconstruct the unique bulk metric tensor once a gauge choice is made. We then examine the emergent bulk geometries for static and dynamical scenarios in holography and in many-body systems.

	abstract = {<p>Quantum computers can sometimes exponentially outperform classical ones, but only for problems with sufficient structure. While it is well known that query problems with full permutation symmetry can have at most polynomial quantum speedup -- even for partial functions -- it is unclear how far this condition must be relaxed to enable exponential speedup. In particular, it is natural to ask whether exponential speedup is possible for (partial) graph properties, in which the input describes a graph and the output can only depend on its isomorphism class. We show that the answer to this question depends strongly on the input model. In the adjacency matrix model, we prove that the bounded-error randomized query complexity R of any graph property P has R(P)=O(Q(P)6), where Q is the bounded-error quantum query complexity. This negatively resolves an open question of Montanaro and de Wolf in the adjacency matrix model. More generally, we prove R(P)=O(Q(P)3l) for any l-uniform hypergraph property P in the adjacency matrix model. In direct contrast, in the adjacency list model for bounded-degree graphs, we exhibit a promise problem that shows an exponential separation between the randomized and quantum query complexities.</p>},

We investigate the character of the motional modes of a mixed-species ion chain for entangling operations and also sympathetic cooling. We find that the laser power required for high-fidelity entangling gates based on transverse modes is at least an order of magnitude higher than that based on axial modes for widely different masses of the two species. We also find that for even moderate mass differences, the transverse modes are much harder to cool than the axial modes regardless of the ion chain configuration.

These conjectures are intriguing allusions to the unresolved potential of combining classical and low-depth quantum computation. In this work we show that the Welded Tree Problem, which is an oracle problem that can be solved in quantum polynomial time as shown by Childs et al.

This proves Aaronson\&$\#$39;s oracle separation conjecture and provides a counterpoint to Jozsa\&$\#$39;s conjecture relative to the Welded Tree oracle problem. More precisely, we define two complexity classes, HQC and JC whose languages are decided by two different families of interleaved quantum-classical circuits. HQC contains BPPBQNC and is therefore relevant to Aaronson\&$\#$39;s conjecture, while JC captures the model of computation that Jozsa considers. We show that the Welded Tree Problem gives an oracle separation between either of {JC,HQC} and BQP.

	year = {2020},
	month = {12/8/2020},
	abstract = {<p>In a recent breakthrough, Mahadev constructed a classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) protocol for a classical client to delegate decision problems in BQP to an untrusted quantum prover under computational assumptions. In this work, we explore further the feasibility of CVQC with the more general sampling problems in BQP and with the desirable blindness property. We contribute affirmative solutions to both as follows. (1) Motivated by the sampling nature of many quantum applications (e.g., quantum algorithms for machine learning and quantum supremacy tasks), we initiate the study of CVQC for quantum sampling problems (denoted by SampBQP). More precisely, in a CVQC protocol for a SampBQP problem, the prover and the verifier are given an input x\&isin;{0,1}n and a quantum circuit C, and the goal of the classical client is to learn a sample from the output z\&larr;C(x) up to a small error, from its interaction with an untrusted prover. We demonstrate its feasibility by constructing a four-message CVQC protocol for SampBQP based on the quantum Learning With Error assumption. (2) The blindness of CVQC protocols refers to a property of the protocol where the prover learns nothing, and hence is blind, about the client\&$\#$39;s input. It is a highly desirable property that has been intensively studied for the delegation of quantum computation. We provide a simple yet powerful generic compiler that transforms any CVQC protocol to a blind one while preserving its completeness and soundness errors as well as the number of rounds. Applying our compiler to (a parallel repetition of) Mahadev\&$\#$39;s CVQC protocol for BQP and our CVQC protocol for SampBQP yields the first constant-round blind CVQC protocol for BQP and SampBQP respectively, with negligible completeness and soundness errors.</p>},

	month = {2/5/2020},
	abstract = {<p>Bell inequality with self-testing property has played an important role in quantum information field with both fundamental and practical applications. However, it is generally challenging to find Bell inequalities with self-testing property for multipartite states and actually there are not many known candidates. In this work, we propose a systematical framework to construct Bell inequalities from stabilizers which are maximally violated by general stabilizer states, with two observables for each local party. We show that the constructed Bell inequalities can self-test any stabilizer state which is essentially device-independent, if and only if these stabilizers can uniquely determine the state in a device-dependent manner. This bridges the gap between device-independent and device-dependent verification methods. Our framework can provide plenty of Bell inequalities for self-testing stabilizer states. Among them, we give two families of Bell inequalities with different advantages: (1) a family of Bell inequalities with a constant ratio of quantum and classical bounds using 2N correlations, (2) Single pair inequalities improving on all previous robustness self-testing bounds using N+1 correlations, which are both efficient and suitable for realizations in multipartite systems. Our framework can not only inspire more fruitful multipartite Bell inequalities from conventional verification methods, but also pave the way for their practical applications.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum error correction and symmetry arise in many areas of physics, including many-body systems, metrology in the presence of noise, fault-tolerant computation, and holographic quantum gravity. Here we study the compatibility of these two important principles. If a logical quantum system is encoded into n physical subsystems, we say that the code is covariant with respect to a symmetry group G if a G transformation on the logical system can be realized by performing transformations on the individual subsystems. For a G-covariant code with G a continuous group, we derive a lower bound on the error correction infidelity following erasure of a subsystem. This bound approaches zero when the number of subsystems n or the dimension d of each subsystem is large. We exhibit codes achieving approximately the same scaling of infidelity with n or d as the lower bound. Leveraging tools from representation theory, we prove an approximate version of the Eastin-Knill theorem: If a code admits a universal set of transversal gates and corrects erasure with fixed accuracy, then, for each logical qubit, we need a number of physical qubits per subsystem that is inversely proportional to the error parameter. We construct codes covariant with respect to the full logical unitary group, achieving good accuracy for large d (using random codes) or n (using codes based on W-states). We systematically construct codes covariant with respect to general groups, obtaining natural generalizations of qubit codes to, for instance, oscillators and rotors. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, our approach provides insight into how time evolution in the bulk corresponds to time evolution on the boundary without violating the Eastin-Knill theorem, and our five-rotor code can be stacked to form a covariant holographic code.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Photon blockade is the result of the interplay between the quantized nature of light and strong optical nonlinearities, whereby strong photon-photon repulsion prevents a quantum optical system from absorbing multiple photons. We theoretically study a single atom coupled to the light field, described by the resonantly driven Jaynes--Cummings model, in which case the photon blockade breaks down in a second order phase transition at a critical drive strength. We show that this transition is associated to the spontaneous breaking of an anti-unitary PT-symmetry. Within a semiclassical approximation we calculate the expectation values of observables in the steady state. We then move beyond the semiclassical approximation and approach the critical point from the disordered (blockaded) phase by reducing the Lindblad quantum master equation to a classical rate equation that we solve. The width of the steady-state distribution in Fock space is found to diverge as we approach the critical point with a simple power-law, allowing us to calculate the critical scaling of steady state observables without invoking mean-field theory. We propose a simple physical toy model for biased diffusion in the space of occupation numbers, which captures the universal properties of the steady state. We list several experimental platforms where this phenomenon may be observed.</p>},

In this paper, we study the cost of digitally simulating the dynamics of several physically relevant systems using the first-order product formula algorithm.

In particular, we prove that the total error in simulating a nearest-neighbor interacting system of n sites for time t using the first-order product formula with r time slices is O(nt/r+nt3/r2) when nt2/r is less than a small constant. Given an error tolerance ε, the error bound yields an estimate of max{O(n2t/ε),O(n2t3/2/ε1/2)} for the total gate count of the simulation. The estimate is tighter than previous bounds and matches the empirical performance observed in Childs et al. [PNAS 115, 9456-9461 (2018)].

However, that vector is the wavefunction amplitude in the quantum spin model, whereas it is the probability itself in the population model. We show that this seemingly minor difference has significant consequences: phase transitions which are discontinuous in the spin system become continuous when viewed through the population perspective, and transitions which are continuous become governed by new critical exponents. We introduce a more general class of models which encompasses both cases, and that can be solved exactly in a mean-field limit. Numerical results are also presented for a number of one-dimensional chains with power-law interactions. We see that well-worn spin models of quantum statistical mechanics can contain unexpected new physics and insights when treated as population-dynamical models and beyond, motivating further studies.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Continuously monitoring the environment of a quantum many-body system reduces the entropy of (purifies) the reduced density matrix of the system, conditional on the outcomes of the measurements. We show that, for mixed initial states, a balanced competition between measurements and entangling interactions within the system can result in a dynamical purification phase transition between (i) a phase that locally purifies at a constant system-size-independent rate, and (ii) a \&quot;mixed\&quot; phase where the purification time diverges exponentially in the system size. The residual entropy density in the mixed phase implies the existence of a quantum error-protected subspace where quantum information is reliably encoded against the future non-unitary evolution of the system. We show that these codes are of potential relevance to fault-tolerant quantum computation as they are often highly degenerate and satisfy optimal tradeoffs between encoded information densities and error thresholds. In spatially local models in 1+1 dimensions, this phase transition for mixed initial states occurs concurrently with a recently identified class of entanglement phase transitions for pure initial states. The mutual information of an initially completely-mixed state in 1+1 dimensions grows sublinearly in time due to the formation of the error protected subspace. The purification transition studied here also generalizes to systems with long-range interactions, where conventional notions of entanglement transitions have to be reformulated. Purification dynamics is likely a more robust probe of the transition in experiments, where imperfections generically reduce entanglement and drive the system towards mixed states.

	abstract = {<p>All known examples confirming the possibility of an exponential separation between classical simulation algorithms and stoquastic adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) exploit symmetries that constrain adiabatic dynamics to effective, symmetric subspaces. The symmetries produce large effective eigenvalue gaps, which in turn make adiabatic computation efficient. We present a classical algorithm to efficiently sample from the effective subspace of a k-local stoquastic Hamiltonian H, without a priori knowledge of its symmetries (or near-symmetries). Our algorithm maps any k-local Hamiltonian to a graph G=(V,E) with |V|=O(poly(n)) where n is the number of qubits. Given the well-known result of Babai, we exploit graph isomorphism to study the automorphisms of G and arrive at an algorithm quasi-polynomial in |V| for producing samples from the effective subspace eigenstates of H. Our results rule out exponential separations between stoquastic AQC and classical computation that arise from hidden symmetries in k-local Hamiltonians. Furthermore, our graph representation of H is not limited to stoquastic Hamiltonians and may rule out corresponding obstructions in non-stoquastic cases, or be useful in studying additional properties of k-local Hamiltonians.</p>},

Consequently, protocols with high finite-data efficiency are preferred. To yield such protocols with respect to quantum side information, we develop quantum probability estimation. Our approach is applicable to device-independent as well as device-dependent scenarios, and it generalizes techniques from previous works [Miller and Shi, SIAM J. Comput. 46, 1304 (2017); Arnon-Friedman et al., Nat. Commun. 9, 459 (2018)]. Quantum probability estimation can adapt to changing experimental conditions, allows stopping the experiment as soon as the prespecified randomness goal is achieved, and can tolerate imperfect knowledge of the input distribution. Moreover, the randomness rate achieved at constant error is asymptotically optimal. For the device-independent scenario, our approach certifies the amount of randomness available in experimental results without first searching for relations between randomness and violations of fixed Bell inequalities. We implement quantum probability estimation for device-independent randomness generation in the CHSH Bell-test configuration, and we show significant improvements in finite-data efficiency, particularly at small Bell violations which are typical in current photonic loophole-free Bell tests.</p>},

As a first application, we use the min-thauma to bound the regularized relative entropy of magic. As a consequence of this bound, we find that two classes of states with maximal mana, a previously established magic measure, cannot be interconverted in the asymptotic regime at a rate equal to one. This result resolves a basic question in the resource theory of magic states and reveals a fundamental difference between the resource theory of magic states and other resource theories such as entanglement and coherence. As a second application, we establish the hypothesis testing thauma as an efficiently computable benchmark for the one-shot distillable magic, which in turn leads to a variety of bounds on the rate at which magic can be distilled, as well as on the overhead of magic state distillation.

Specifically, we analyze the competition between two different dissipation channels arising from two incompatible continuous monitoring protocols. The first protocol locks the phase of neighboring sites upon registering a quantum jump, thereby generating a long-range entanglement through the system, while the second one destroys the coherence via dephasing mechanism. By studying the unraveling of stochastic quantum trajectories associated with the continuous monitoring protocols, we present a transition for the scaling of the averaged trajectory entanglement entropies, from critical scaling to area-law behavior.

An encoded logical qubit thus carries increased complexity compared to a bare physical qubit. Fault-tolerant protocols contain the spread of errors and are essential for realizing error suppression with an error-corrected logical qubit. Here we experimentally demonstrate fault-tolerant preparation, rotation, error syndrome extraction, and measurement on a logical qubit encoded in the 9-qubit Bacon-Shor code. For the logical qubit, we measure an average fault-tolerant preparation and measurement error of 0.6\% and a transversal Clifford gate with an error of 0.3\% after error correction. The result is an encoded logical qubit whose logical fidelity exceeds the fidelity of the entangling operations used to create it. We compare these operations with non-fault-tolerant protocols capable of generating arbitrary logical states, and observe the expected increase in error. We directly measure the four Bacon-Shor stabilizer generators and are able to detect single qubit Pauli errors.

	abstract = {<p>Weak measurement in tandem with real-time feedback control is a new route toward engineering novel non-equilibrium quantum matter. Here we develop a theoretical toolbox for quantum feedback control of multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) using backaction-limited weak measurements in conjunction with spatially resolved feedback. Feedback in the form of a single-particle potential can introduce effective interactions that enter into the stochastic equation governing system dynamics. The effective interactions are tunable and can be made analogous to Feshbach resonances -- spin-independent and spin-dependent -- but without changing atomic scattering parameters. Feedback cooling prevents runaway heating due to measurement backaction and we present an analytical model to explain its effectiveness. We showcase our toolbox by studying a two-component BEC using a stochastic mean-field theory, where feedback induces a phase transition between easy-axis ferromagnet and spin-disordered paramagnet phases. We present the steady-state phase diagram as a function of intrinsic and effective spin-dependent interaction strengths. Our result demonstrates that closed-loop quantum control of Bose-Einstein condensates is a powerful new tool for quantum engineering in cold-atom systems.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>In quantum many-body systems with local interactions, quantum information and entanglement cannot spread outside of a \&quot;linear light cone,\&quot; which expands at an emergent velocity analogous to the speed of light. Yet most non-relativistic physical systems realized in nature have long-range interactions: two degrees of freedom separated by a distance r interact with potential energy V(r)\&prop;1/rα. In systems with long-range interactions, we rigorously establish a hierarchy of linear light cones: at the same α, some quantum information processing tasks are constrained by a linear light cone while others are not. In one spatial dimension, commutators of local operators \&lang;ψ|[Ox(t),Oy]|ψ\&rang; are negligible in every state |ψ\&rang; when |x\&minus;y|≳vt, where v is finite when α\&gt;3 (Lieb-Robinson light cone); in a typical state |ψ\&rang; drawn from the infinite temperature ensemble, v is finite when α\&gt;52 (Frobenius light cone); in non-interacting systems, v is finite in every state when α\&gt;2 (free light cone). These bounds apply to time-dependent systems and are optimal up to subalgebraic improvements. Our theorems regarding the Lieb-Robinson and free light cones, and their tightness, also generalize to arbitrary dimensions. We discuss the implications of our bounds on the growth of connected correlators and of topological order, the clustering of correlations in gapped systems, and the digital simulation of systems with long-range interactions. In addition, we show that quantum state transfer and many-body quantum chaos are bounded by the Frobenius light cone, and therefore are poorly constrained by all Lieb-Robinson bounds.</p>},

The latter arises naturally from the confinement of domain walls. Remarkably, while some connected components of the Hilbert space thermalize, others are integrable by Bethe ansatz. We further demonstrate how this Hilbert-space fragmentation pattern arises perturbatively in the confining limit of Z2 gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter, leading to a hierarchy of time scales for motion of the fermions.

A promising direction that circumvents this impossibility result is to obfuscate classical circuits into quantum states, which would potentially be better capable of hiding information about the obfuscated circuit. We show that, under the assumption that learning-with-errors (LWE) is hard for quantum computers, this quantum variant of virtual black-box obfuscation of classical circuits is generally impossible.

We examine how classical simulability of noninteracting fermions is modified in the presence of Markovian dissipation described by quadratic Lindblad operators, including, for example, incoherent transitions or pair losses. On the one hand, we establish three broad classes of Markovian dynamics that are efficiently simulable classically, by devising efficient algorithms. On the other hand, we demonstrate that, in the worst case, simulating Markovian dynamics with quadratic Lindblad operators is at least as hard as simulating universal quantum circuits. This result is applicable to an experimentally relevant setting in cold atomic systems, where magnetic Feshbach resonances can be used to engineer the desired dissipation. For such systems, our hardness result provides a direct scheme for dissipation-assisted quantum computing with a potential significant advantage in the speed of two-qubit gates and, therefore, in error tolerance.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Driven-dissipative systems can exhibit non-equilibrium phenomena that are absent in their equilibrium counterparts. However, phase transitions present in these systems generically exhibit an effectively classical equilibrium behavior in spite of their quantum non-equilibrium origin. In this paper, we show that multicritical points in driven-dissipative systems can give rise to genuinely non-equilibrium behavior. We investigate a non-equilibrium driven-dissipative model of interacting bosons that exhibits two distinct phase transitions: one from a high- to a low-density phase---reminiscent of a liquid-gas transition---and another to an antiferromagnetic phase. Each phase transition is described by the Ising universality class characterized by an (emergent or microscopic) Z2 symmetry. They, however, coalesce at a multicritical point giving rise to a non-equilibrium model of coupled Ising-like order parameters described by a Z2\&times;Z2 symmetry. Using a dynamical renormalization-group approach, we show that a pair of non-equilibrium fixed points (NEFPs) emerge that govern the long-distance critical behavior of the system. We elucidate various exotic features of these NEFPs. In particular, we show that a generic continuous scale invariance at criticality is reduced to a discrete scale invariance. This further results in complex-valued critical exponents, spiraling phase boundaries, and a complex Liouvillian gap even close to the phase transition. As direct evidence of the non-equilibrium nature of the NEFPs, we show that the fluctuation-dissipation relation is violated at all scales, leading to an effective temperature that becomes \&quot;hotter\&quot; and \&quot;hotter\&quot; at longer and longer wavelengths.

We calculate the non-equilibrium steady states of a boundary-driven strongly interacting Aubry-Andre-Harper model by employing the time-evolving block decimation algorithm on matrix product density operators. From these steady states, we extract spin transport as a function of system size and quasiperiodic potential strength. This data shows spin transport going from superdiffusive to subdiffusive well before the localization transition; comparing to previous results, we also find that the transport transition is distinct from a transition observed in the speed of operator growth in the model. We also investigate the correlation structure of the steady state and find an unusual oscillation pattern for intermediate values of the potential strength.

	abstract = {<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic highlights the utility of contact tracing, when combined with case isolation and social distancing, as an important tool for mitigating the spread of a disease [1]. Contact tracing provides a mechanism of identifying individuals with a high likelihood of previous exposure to a contagious disease, allowing additional precautions to be put in place to prevent continued transmission. Here we consider a cryptographic approach to contact tracing based on secure two-party computation (2PC). We begin by considering the problem of comparing a set of location histories held by two parties to determine whether they have come within some threshold distance while at the same time maintaining the privacy of the location histories. We propose a solution to this problem using pre-shared keys, adapted from an equality testing protocol due to Ishai et al [2]. We discuss how this protocol can be used to maintain privacy within practical contact tracing scenarios, including both app-based approaches and approaches which leverage location history held by telecoms and internet service providers. We examine the efficiency of this approach and show that existing infrastructure is sufficient to support anonymised contact tracing at a national level.</p>},

Yet a bright on-demand, highly pure and highly indistinguishable single-photon source compatible with atomic platforms is lacking. In this work, we demonstrate such a source based on a strongly interacting Rydberg system. The large optical nonlinearities in a blockaded Rydberg ensemble convert coherent light into a single-collective excitation that can be coherently retrieved as a quantum field. We observe a single-transverse-mode efficiency up to 0.18(2), g(2)=2.0(1.5)\&times;10\&minus;4, and indistinguishability of 0.982(7), making this system promising for scalable quantum information applications. Accounting for losses, we infer a generation probability up to 0.40(4). Furthermore, we investigate the effects of contaminant Rydberg excitations on the source efficiency. Finally, we introduce metrics to benchmark the performance of on-demand single-photon sources.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>A fundamental problem in resource theory is to study the manipulation of the resource. Focusing on a general dynamical resource theory of quantum channels, here we consider tasks of one-shot resource distillation and dilution with a single copy of the resource. For any target of unitary channel or pure state preparation channel, we establish a universal strategy to determine upper and lower bounds on rates that convert between any given resource and the target. We show that the rates are related to resource measures based on the channel robustness and the channel hypothesis testing entropy, with regularization factors of the target resource measures. The strategy becomes optimal with converged bounds when the channel robustness is finite and measures of the target resource collapse to the same value. The single-shot result also applies to asymptotic parallel manipulation of channels to obtain asymptotic resource conversion rates. We give several examples of dynamical resources, including the purity, classical capacity, quantum capacity, non-uniformity, coherence, and entanglement of quantum channels. Our results are applicable to general dynamical resource theories with potential applications in quantum communication, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and quantum thermodynamics.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum systems are promising candidates for sensing of weak signals as they can provide unrivaled performance when estimating parameters of external fields. However, when trying to detect weak signals that are hidden by background noise, the signal-to-noise-ratio is a more relevant metric than raw sensitivity. We identify, under modest assumptions about the statistical properties of the signal and noise, the optimal quantum control to detect an external signal in the presence of background noise using a quantum sensor. Interestingly, for white background noise, the optimal solution is the simple and well-known spin-locking control scheme. We further generalize, using numerical techniques, these results to the background noise being a correlated Lorentzian spectrum. We show that for increasing correlation time, pulse based sequences such as CPMG are also close to the optimal control for detecting the signal, with the crossover dependent on the signal frequency. These results show that an optimal detection scheme can be easily implemented in near-term quantum sensors without the need for complicated pulse shaping.</p>},

The Clifford+CS gate set is universal for quantum computation and its elements can be implemented fault-tolerantly in most error-correcting schemes with magic state distillation. However, since non-Clifford gates are typically more expensive to perform in a fault-tolerant manner, it is desirable to construct circuits that use few CS gates. In the present paper, we introduce an algorithm to construct optimal circuits for two-qubit Clifford+CS operators. Our algorithm inputs a Clifford+CS operator U and efficiently produces a Clifford+CS circuit for U using the least possible number of CS gates. Because our algorithm is deterministic, the circuit it associates to a Clifford+CS operator can be viewed as a normal form for the operator. We give a formal description of these normal forms as walks over certain graphs and use this description to derive an asymptotic lower bound of 5log(1/epsilon)+O(1) on the number CS gates required to epsilon-approximate any 4x4 unitary matrix.\&nbsp;</p>},

The need for gradient information in the training procedure of VQC applications has stimulated the development of auto-differentiation techniques for quantum circuits. We propose the first formalization of this technique, not only in the context of quantum circuits but also for imperative quantum programs (e.g., with controls), inspired by the success of differentiable programming languages in classical machine learning. In particular, we overcome a few unique difficulties caused by exotic quantum features (such as quantum no-cloning) and provide a rigorous formulation of differentiation applied to bounded-loop imperative quantum programs, its code-transformation rules, as well as a sound logic to reason about their correctness. Moreover, we have implemented our code transformation in OCaml and demonstrated the resource-efficiency of our scheme both analytically and empirically. We also conduct a case study of training a VQC instance with controls, which shows the advantage of our scheme over existing auto-differentiation for quantum circuits without controls.</p>},

Studying this phenomenon on a quantum computer without error correction is challenging because even weak coupling to a thermal environment destroys most signatures of localization. Fortunately, spectral functions of local operators are known to contain features that can survive the presence of noise. In these spectra, discrete peaks and a soft gap at low frequencies compared to the thermal phase indicate localization. Here, we present the computation of spectral functions on a trapped-ion quantum computer for a one-dimensional Heisenberg model with disorder. Further, we design an error-mitigation technique which is effective at removing the noise from the measurement allowing clear signatures of localization to emerge as the disorder increases.

In particular, we examine not only the unfrustrated case but also the fully-frustrated case which leads to enhanced degeneracy associated with the spin rotational [U(1)] and discrete chiral (Z2) symmetries. The nature of the transition in the frustrated case has posed a challenge for theoretical studies while direct experimental probes remain elusive. Here we identify the transition temperatures for both the unfrustrated and fully-frustrated XY models by probing a Josephson junction array close to equilibrium using weak microwave excitations and measuring the temperature dependence of the effective damping obtained from the complex reflection coefficient.

The quest for discovering larger families of distributions for which sampling can be efficiently realized has inspired an exploration beyond established computing methods and turning to novel physical devices that leverage the principles of quantum computation. Quantum annealing embodies a promising computational paradigm that is intimately related to the complexity of energy landscapes in Gibbs distributions, which relate the probabilities of system states to the energies of these states. Here, we study the sampling properties of physical realizations of quantum annealers which are implemented through programmable lattices of superconducting flux qubits. Comprehensive statistical analysis of the data produced by these quantum machines shows that quantum annealers behave as samplers that generate independent configurations from low-temperature noisy Gibbs distributions. We show that the structure of the output distribution probes the intrinsic physical properties of the quantum device such as effective temperature of individual qubits and magnitude of local qubit noise, which result in a non-linear response function and spurious interactions that are absent in the hardware implementation.

Here we attempt to solve PEPs in a quantum computer. Firstly, for generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) $A\x = \lambda B\x$ with A,B symmetric, and B positive definite, we give a quantum algorithm based on block-encoding and quantum phase estimation. In a more general case when B is invertible, B\&minus;1A is diagonalizable and all the eigenvalues are real, we propose a quantum algorithm based on the Fourier spectral method to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The inputs of our algorithms can be any desired states, and the outputs are superpositions of the eigenpairs. The complexities are polylog in the matrix size and linear in the precision. The dependence on precision is optimal. Secondly, we show that when B is singular, any quantum algorithm uses at least Ω(n\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;) queries to compute the eigenvalues, where n is the matrix size. Thirdly, based on the linearization method and the connection between PEPs and higher-order ODEs, we provide two quantum algorithms to solve PEPs by extending the quantum algorithm for GEPs. We also give detailed complexity analysis of the algorithm for two special types of quadratic eigenvalue problems that are important in practice.

	abstract = {<p>Large-scale quantum computing poses a major threat to classical public-key cryptography. Recently, strong \&ldquo;quantum access\&rdquo; security models have shown that numerous symmetric-key cryptosystems are also vulnerable. In this paper, we consider classical encryption in a model that grants the adversary quantum oracle access to encryption and decryption, but where we restrict the latter to non-adaptive (i.e., pre-challenge) queries only. We formalize this model using appropriate notions of ciphertext indistinguishability and semantic security (which are equivalent by standard arguments) and call it QCCA1 in analogy to the classical CCA1 security model. We show that the standard pseudorandom function ( PRF )-based encryption schemes are QCCA1 -secure when instantiated with quantum-secure primitives. Our security proofs use a strong bound on quantum random-access codes with shared randomness. Revisiting plain IND\&minus;CPA -secure Learning with Errors ( LWE ) encryption, we show that leaking only a single quantum decryption query (and no other leakage or queries of any kind) allows the adversary to recover the full secret key with constant success probability. Information-theoretically, full recovery of the key in the classical setting requires at least a linear number of decryption queries. Our results thus challenge the notion that LWE is unconditionally \&ldquo;just as secure\&rdquo; quantumly as it is classically. The algorithm at the core of our attack is a new variant of the well-known Bernstein\&ndash;Vazirani algorithm. Finally, we emphasize that our results should not be interpreted as a weakness of these cryptosystems in their stated security setting (i.e., post-quantum chosen-plaintext secrecy). Rather, our results mean that, if these cryptosystems are exposed to chosen-ciphertext attacks (e.g., as a result of deployment in an inappropriate real-world setting) then quantum attacks are even more devastating than classical ones.</p>},

	year = {2020},
	month = {10/19/2020},
	abstract = {<p>Random quantum circuits have played a central role in establishing the computational advantages of near-term quantum computers over their conventional counterparts. Here, we use ensembles of low-depth random circuits with local connectivity in D\&ge;1 spatial dimensions to generate quantum error-correcting codes. For random stabilizer codes and the erasure channel, we find strong evidence that a depth O(logN) random circuit is necessary and sufficient to converge (with high probability) to zero failure probability for any finite amount below the channel capacity for any D. Previous results on random circuits have only shown that O(N1/D) depth suffices or that O(log3N) depth suffices for all-to-all connectivity (D\&rarr;\&infin;). We then study the critical behavior of the erasure threshold in the so-called moderate deviation limit, where both the failure probability and the distance to the channel capacity converge to zero with N. We find that the requisite depth scales like O(logN) only for dimensions D\&ge;2, and that random circuits require O(N\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;) depth for D=1. Finally, we introduce an \&quot;expurgation\&quot; algorithm that uses quantum measurements to remove logical operators that cause the code to fail by turning them into either additional stabilizers or into gauge operators in a subsystem code. With such targeted measurements, we can achieve sub-logarithmic depth in D\&ge;2 spatial dimensions below capacity without increasing the maximum weight of the check operators. We find that for any rate beneath the capacity, high-performing codes with thousands of logical qubits are achievable with depth 4-8 expurgated random circuits in D=2 dimensions. These results indicate that finite-rate quantum codes are practically relevant for near-term devices and may significantly reduce the resource requirements to achieve fault tolerance for near-term applications.\&nbsp;</p>},

Our mapping provides a computational tool to determine observables of the discrete system even for large lattices, where exact diagonalization fails.

Thus far, researchers focus on powerful models to handle the deblurring problem and achieve decent results. For this work, in a new aspect, we discover the great opportunity for image enhancement (e.g., deblurring) directly from RAW images and investigate novel neural network structures benefiting RAW-based learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no available RAW image deblurring dataset. Therefore, we built a new dataset containing both RAW images and processed sRGB images and design a new model to utilize the unique characteristics of RAW images. The proposed deblurring model, trained solely from RAW images, achieves the state-of-art performance and outweighs those trained on processed sRGB images. Furthermore, with fine-tuning, the proposed model, trained on our new dataset, can generalize to other sensors. Additionally, by a series of experiments, we demonstrate that existing deblurring models can also be improved by training on the RAW images in our new dataset. Ultimately, we show a new venue for further opportunities based on the devised novel raw-based deblurring method and the brand-new Deblur-RAW dataset.</p>},

In particular, our classical SVT framework recovers and often improves the dequantization results on recommendation systems, principal component analysis, supervised clustering, support vector machines, low-rank regression, and semidefinite program solving. We also give additional dequantization results on low-rank Hamiltonian simulation and discriminant analysis.

Extensions of these techniques can enable directionally-sensitive searches for a broad class of previously inaccessible heavy dark matter candidates.\&nbsp;</p>},

	title = {Secure Quantum Two-Party Computation: Impossibility and Constructions},
	year = {2020},
	month = {10/15/2020},
	abstract = {<p>Secure two-party computation considers the problem of two parties computing a joint function of their private inputs without revealing anything beyond the output of the computation. In this work, we take the first steps towards understanding the setting in which the two parties want to evaluate a joint quantum functionality while using only a classical channel between them. Our first result indicates that it is in general impossible to realize a two-party quantum functionality against malicious adversaries with black-box simulation, relying only on classical channels. The negative result stems from reducing the existence of a black-box simulator to an extractor for classical proof of quantum knowledge, which in turn leads to violation of the quantum no-cloning. Next, we introduce the notion of oblivious quantum function evaluation (OQFE). An OQFE is a two-party quantum cryptographic primitive with one fully classical party (Alice) whose input is (a classical description of a) quantum unitary, U, and a quantum party (Bob) whose input is a quantum state, ψ. In particular, Alice receives a classical output corresponding to the measurement of U(ψ) while Bob receives no output. In OQFE, Bob remains oblivious to Alice\&$\#$39;s input, while Alice learns nothing about ψ more than what can be learned from the output. We present two constructions, one secure against semi-honest parties and the other against malicious parties. Due to the no-go result mentioned above, we consider what is arguably the best possible notion obtainable in our model concerning malicious adversaries: one-sided simulation security. Our protocol relies on the assumption of injective homomorphic trapdoor OWFs, which in turn rely on the LWE problem. As a result, we put forward a first, simple and modular, construction of one-sided quantum two-party computation and quantum oblivious transfer over classical networks.</p>},

	title = {Security Limitations of Classical-Client Delegated Quantum Computing},
	year = {2020},
	month = {7/3/2020},
	abstract = {<p>Secure delegated quantum computing allows a computationally weak client to outsource an arbitrary quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server in a privacy-preserving manner. One of the promising candidates to achieve classical delegation of quantum computation is classical-client remote state preparation (RSPCC), where a client remotely prepares a quantum state using a classical channel. However, the privacy loss incurred by employing RSPCC as a sub-module is unclear.<br />In this work, we investigate this question using the Constructive Cryptography framework by Maurer and Renner (ICS\&$\#$39;11). We first identify the goal of RSPCC as the construction of ideal RSP resources from classical channels and then reveal the security limitations of using RSPCC. First, we uncover a fundamental relationship between constructing ideal RSP resources (from classical channels) and the task of cloning quantum states. Any classically constructed ideal RSP resource must leak to the server the full classical description (possibly in an encoded form) of the generated quantum state, even if we target computational security only. As a consequence, we find that the realization of common RSP resources, without weakening their guarantees drastically, is impossible due to the no-cloning theorem. Second, the above result does not rule out that a specific RSPCC protocol can replace the quantum channel at least in some contexts, such as the Universal Blind Quantum Computing (UBQC) protocol of Broadbent et al. (FOCS \&$\#$39;09). However, we show that the resulting UBQC protocol cannot maintain its proven composable security as soon as RSPCC is used as a subroutine. Third, we show that replacing the quantum channel of the above UBQC protocol by the RSPCC protocol QFactory of Cojocaru et al. (Asiacrypt \&$\#$39;19), preserves the weaker, game-based, security of UBQC.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Strongly long-range interacting quantum systems---those with interactions decaying as a power-law 1/rα in the distance r on a D-dimensional lattice for α\&le;D---have received significant interest in recent years. They are present in leading experimental platforms for quantum computation and simulation, as well as in theoretical models of quantum information scrambling and fast entanglement creation. Since no notion of locality is expected in such systems, a general understanding of their dynamics is lacking. As a first step towards rectifying this problem, we prove two new Lieb-Robinson-type bounds that constrain the time for signaling and scrambling in strongly long-range interacting systems, for which no tight bounds were previously known. Our first bound applies to systems mappable to free-particle Hamiltonians with long-range hopping, and is saturable for α\&le;D/2. Our second bound pertains to generic long-range interacting spin Hamiltonians, and leads to a tight lower bound for the signaling time to extensive subsets of the system for all α\&lt;D. This result also lower-bounds the scrambling time, and suggests a path towards achieving a tight scrambling bound that can prove the long-standing fast scrambling conjecture.\&nbsp;</p>},

Understanding whether a small quantum computer can simulate a larger quantum system, or execute an algorithm requiring more qubits than available, is both of theoretical and practical importance. In this Letter, we introduce cluster parameters K and d of a quantum circuit. The tensor network of such a circuit can be decomposed into clusters of size at most d with at most K qubits of inter-cluster quantum communication. Our main result is a simulation scheme of any (K,d)-clustered quantum circuit on a d-qubit machine in time roughly 2O(K). An important application of our result is the simulation of clustered quantum systems---such as large molecules---that can be partitioned into multiple significantly smaller clusters with weak interactions among them. Another potential application is quantum optimization: we demonstrate numerically that variational quantum eigensolvers can still perform well when restricted to clustered circuits, thus making it feasible to study large quantum systems on small quantum devices.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>We study a sparse version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model defined on random hypergraphs constructed either by a random pruning procedure or by randomly sampling regular hypergraphs. The resulting model has a new parameter, k, defined as the ratio of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian to the number of degrees of freedom, with the sparse limit corresponding to the thermodynamic limit at fixed k. We argue that this sparse SYK model recovers the interesting global physics of ordinary SYK even when k is of order unity. In particular, at low temperature the model exhibits a gravitational sector which is maximally chaotic. Our argument proceeds by constructing a path integral for the sparse model which reproduces the conventional SYK path integral plus gapped fluctuations. The sparsity of the model permits larger scale numerical calculations than previously possible, the results of which are consistent with the path integral analysis. Additionally, we show that the sparsity of the model considerably reduces the cost of quantum simulation algorithms. This makes the sparse SYK model the most efficient currently known route to simulate a holographic model of quantum gravity. We also define and study a sparse supersymmetric SYK model, with similar conclusions to the non-supersymmetric case. Looking forward, we argue that the class of models considered here constitute an interesting and relatively unexplored sparse frontier in quantum many-body physics.</p>},

In particular, we focus on spin-mediated doublon-holon pairing in Hubbard materials. We use several complementary theoretical techniques: mean-field theory to describe the spin degrees of freedom, the self-consistent Born approximation to characterize individual charge excitations across the Hubbard gap, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to identify bound states of doublons and holons. The binding energy of the Hubbard exciton is found to increase with increasing the N{{\'e}}el order parameter, while the exciton mass decreases. We observe that these trends rely significantly on the retardation of the effective interaction, and require consideration of multiple effects from changing the magnetic order. Our results are consistent with the key qualitative trends observed in recent experiments on iridates. Moreover, the findings could have direct implications on ultracold atom Mott insulators, where the Hubbard model is the exact description of the system and the microscopic degrees of freedom can be directly accessed.\&nbsp;</p>},

The rescaled Dyson-series algorithm is nearly optimal with respect to all parameters of interest, whereas the sampling-based approach is easier to realize for near-term simulation.

From this general bound, we establish a family of speed limits for heat, work, entropy production, and entropy flow depending on the experimental constraints on the system. In all of these inequalities, the time scale of transient dynamical fluctuations is universally bounded by the Fisher information. Moreover, they all have a mathematical form that mirrors the Mandelstam-Tamm version of the time-energy uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics.

Engineered atom-laser interactions in a linear crystal of trapped ions offer a wide range of possibilities for quantum simulations of complex physical systems. Here, we devise practical proposals for analog simulation of simple lattice gauge theories whose dynamics can be mapped onto spin-spin interactions in any dimension.

Using a combination of numerical and analytical methods, we show that the frustration in this model gives rise to rich physics in a very wide range of energies. This is in contrast to the one-bath spin-boson model, where the non-trivial physics occurs at an energy scale close to the renormalized spin frequency. The renormalized spin frequency in the two-bath spin-boson model is still important, featuring in different observables, including the non-equiblirum dynamics of both the spin and the baths along with the elastic transport properties of a photon. The latter however reveals a much more complex structure. The elastic scattering displays non-monotonic behavior at high frequencies, and is very different in the two channels: intra- and inter-bath scattering. The photon can also be inelastically scattered, a process in which it is split into several photons of smaller energies. We show that such inelastic processes are highly anisotropic, with the outgoing particles being preferentially emitted into only one of the baths. Moreover, the inelastic scattering rate is parameterically larger than in the one-bath case, and can even exceed the total elastic rate. Our results can be verified with state-of-the-art circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments.\&nbsp;</p>},

For precision ε, QPE requires O(1) repetitions of circuits with depth O(1/ε), whereas each expectation estimation subroutine within VQE requires O(1/ε2) samples from circuits with depth O(1). We propose a generalised VQE algorithm that interpolates between these two regimes via a free parameter α\&isin;[0,1] which can exploit quantum coherence over a circuit depth of O(1/εα) to reduce the number of samples to O(1/ε2(1\&minus;α)).

	abstract = {<p>We introduce an approximate description of an N-qubit state, which contains sufficient information to estimate the expectation value of any observable with precision independent of N. We show, in fact, that the error in the estimation of the observables\&$\#$39; expectation values decreases as the inverse of the square root of the number of the system\&$\#$39;s identical preparations and increases, at most, linearly in a suitably defined, N-independent, seminorm of the observables. Building the approximate description of the N-qubit state only requires repetitions of single-qubit rotations followed by single-qubit measurements and can be considered for implementation on today\&$\#$39;s Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. The access to the expectation values of all observables for a given state leads to an efficient variational method for the determination of the minimum eigenvalue of an observable. The method represents one example of the practical significance of the approximate description of the N-qubit state.

It has been argued that quantum properties such as tunneling may give quantum algorithms advantage in finding ground states of vast, rugged cost landscapes. Indeed, the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAO) and the recent Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) have shown promising results on various problem instances that are considered classically hard. Here, we argue that the type of control strategy used by the optimization algorithm may be crucial to its success. Along with SA, QAO and QAOA, we define a new, bang-bang version of simulated annealing, BBSA, and study the performance of these algorithms on two well-studied problem instances from the literature. Both classically and quantumly, the successful control strategy is found to be bang-bang, exponentially outperforming the quasistatic analogues on the same instances. Lastly, we construct O(1)-depth QAOA protocols for a class of symmetric cost functions, and provide an accompanying physical picture.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>The many-body localization transition in quasiperiodic systems has been extensively studied in recent ultracold atom experiments. At intermediate quasiperiodic potential strength, a surprising Griffiths-like regime with slow dynamics appears in the absence of random disorder and mobility edges. In this work, we study the interacting Aubry-Andre model, a prototype quasiperiodic system, as a function of incommensurate potential strength using a novel dynamical measure, information scrambling, in a large system of 200 lattice sites. Between the thermal phase and the many-body localized phase, we find an intermediate dynamical phase where the butterfly velocity is zero and information spreads in space as a power-law in time. This is in contrast to the ballistic spreading in the thermal phase and logarithmic spreading in the localized phase. We further investigate the entanglement structure of the many-body eigenstates in the intermediate phase and find strong fluctuations in eigenstate entanglement entropy within a given energy window, which is inconsistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Machine-learning on the entanglement spectrum also reaches the same conclusion. Our large-scale simulations suggest that the intermediate phase with vanishing butterfly velocity could be responsible for the slow dynamics seen in recent experiments.</p>},

We propose efficient circuit transformations that modify a given quantum circuit to fit an architecture, allowing for any initial and final mapping of circuit qubits to architecture qubits. To achieve this, we first consider the qubit movement subproblem and use the routing via matchings framework to prove tighter bounds on parallel routing. In practice, we only need to perform partial permutations, so we generalize routing via matchings to that setting. We give new routing procedures for common architecture graphs and for the generalized hierarchical product of graphs, which produces subgraphs of the Cartesian product. Secondly, for serial routing, we consider the token swapping framework and extend a 4-approximation algorithm for general graphs to support partial permutations. We apply these routing procedures to give several circuit transformations, using various heuristic qubit placement subroutines. We implement these transformations in software and compare their performance for large quantum circuits on grid and modular architectures, identifying strategies that work well in practice.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum characterization, validation, and verification (QCVV) techniques are used to probe, characterize, diagnose, and detect errors in quantum information processors (QIPs). An important component of any QCVV protocol is a mapping from experimental data to an estimate of a property of a QIP. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can help automate the development of QCVV protocols, creating such maps by learning them from training data. We identify the critical components of \&quot;machine-learned\&quot; QCVV techniques, and present a rubric for developing them. To demonstrate this approach, we focus on the problem of determining whether noise affecting a single qubit is coherent or stochastic (incoherent) using the data sets originally proposed for gate set tomography. We leverage known ML algorithms to train a classifier distinguishing these two kinds of noise. The accuracy of the classifier depends on how well it can approximate the \&quot;natural\&quot; geometry of the training data. We find GST data sets generated by a noisy qubit can reliably be separated by linear surfaces, although feature engineering can be necessary. We also show the classifier learned by a support vector machine (SVM) is robust under finite-sample noise.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The Bitcoin protocol prescribes certain behavior by the miners who are responsible for maintaining and extending the underlying blockchain; in particular, miners who successfully solve a puzzle, and hence can extend the chain by a block, are supposed to release that block immediately. Eyal and Sirer showed, however, that a selfish miner is incentivized to deviate from the protocol and withhold its blocks under certain conditions. The analysis by Eyal and Sirer, as well as in followup work, considers a \emph{single} deviating miner (who may control a large fraction of the hashing power in the network) interacting with a remaining pool of honest miners. Here, we extend this analysis to the case where there are \emph{multiple} (non-colluding) selfish miners. We find that with multiple strategic miners, specific deviations from honest mining by multiple strategic agents can outperform honest mining, even if individually miners would not be incentivised to be dishonest. This previous point effectively renders the Bitcoin protocol to be less secure than previously thought.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in topics at the intersection of many-body physics and complexity theory. Many-body physics aims to understand and classify emergent behavior of systems with a large number of particles, while complexity theory aims to classify computational problems based on how the time required to solve the problem scales as the problem size becomes large. In this work, we use insights from complexity theory to classify phases in interacting many-body systems. Specifically, we demonstrate a \&quot;complexity phase diagram\&quot; for the Bose-Hubbard model with long-range hopping. This shows how the complexity of simulating time evolution varies according to various parameters appearing in the problem, such as the evolution time, the particle density, and the degree of locality. We find that classification of complexity phases is closely related to upper bounds on the spread of quantum correlations, and protocols to transfer quantum information in a controlled manner. Our work motivates future studies of complexity in many-body systems and its interplay with the associated physical phenomena.\&nbsp;</p>},

We show that these bound states have dramatic consequences for the non-equilibrium dynamics following a global quantum quench, such as suppressed spreading of quantum information and oscillations of order parameters. The masses of these bound states can be read out from the Fourier spectrum of these oscillating order parameters. We then use a two-kink model to qualitatively explain the phenomenon of long-range-interaction-induced confinement. The masses of the bound states predicted by this model are in good quantitative agreement with exact diagonalization results. Moreover, we illustrate that these bound states lead to weak thermalization of local observables for initial states with energy near the bottom of the many-body energy spectrum.

A critical component of such systems is the interconnect, a device or process that allows transfer of information between disparate physical media, for example, semiconductor electronics, individual atoms, light pulses in optical fiber, or microwave fields. While interconnects have been well engineered for decades in the realm of classical information technology, quantum interconnects (QuICs) present special challenges, as they must allow the transfer of fragile quantum states between different physical parts or degrees of freedom of the system. The diversity of QIT platforms (superconducting, atomic, solid-state color center, optical, etc.) that will form a quantum internet poses additional challenges. As quantum systems scale to larger size, the quantum interconnect bottleneck is imminent, and is emerging as a grand challenge for QIT. For these reasons, it is the position of the community represented by participants of the NSF workshop on Quantum Interconnects that accelerating QuIC research is crucial for sustained development of a national quantum science and technology program. Given the diversity of QIT platforms, materials used, applications, and infrastructure required, a convergent research program including partnership between academia, industry and national laboratories is required.

The small system thermalizes to the canonical ensemble, or the grand canonical ensemble, etc., depending on the charges. The charges are usually represented by operators assumed to commute with each other. This assumption was removed within quantum-information-theoretic (QI-theoretic) thermodynamics recently. The small system\&$\#$39;s long-time state was dubbed \&quot;the non-Abelian thermal state (NATS).\&quot; We propose an experimental protocol for observing a system thermalize to the NATS. We illustrate with a chain of spins, a subset of which form the system of interest. The conserved charges manifest as spin components. Heisenberg interactions push the charges between the system and the effective bath, the rest of the chain. We predict long-time expectation values, extending the NATS theory from abstract idealization to finite systems that thermalize with finite couplings for finite times. Numerical simulations support the analytics: The system thermalizes to the NATS, rather than to the canonical prediction. Our proposal can be implemented with ultracold atoms, nitrogen-vacancy centers, trapped ions, quantum dots, and perhaps nuclear magnetic resonance.

Here we present a Floquet-based framework to stroboscopically engineer Hamiltonians with spatial features and periodicity below the diffraction limit of light used to create them by time-averaging over various configurations of a 1D optical Kronig-Penney (KP) lattice. The KP potential is a lattice of narrow subwavelength barriers spaced by half the optical wavelength (λ/2) and arises from the non-linear optical response of the atomic dark state. Stroboscopic control over the strength and position of this lattice requires time-dependent adiabatic manipulation of the dark state spin composition. We investigate adiabaticity requirements and shape our time-dependent light fields to respect the requirements. We apply this framework to show that a λ/4-spaced lattice can be synthesized using realistic experimental parameters as an example, discuss mechanisms that limit lifetimes in these lattices, explore candidate systems and their limitations, and treat adiabatic loading into the ground band of these lattices.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum computing leverages the quantum resources of superposition and entanglement to efficiently solve computational problems considered intractable for classical computers. Examples include calculating molecular and nuclear structure, simulating strongly-interacting electron systems, and modeling aspects of material function. While substantial theoretical advances have been made in mapping these problems to quantum algorithms, there remains a large gap between the resource requirements for solving such problems and the capabilities of currently available quantum hardware. Bridging this gap will require a co-design approach, where the expression of algorithms is developed in conjunction with the hardware itself to optimize execution. Here, we describe a scalable co-design framework for solving chemistry problems on a trapped ion quantum computer, and apply it to compute the ground-state energy of the water molecule. The robust operation of the trapped ion quantum computer yields energy estimates with errors approaching the chemical accuracy, which is the target threshold necessary for predicting the rates of chemical reaction dynamics.</p>},

Conventional quantum field theory does not conform to this bound, since in this framework, infinitely many degrees of freedom may be localized to any given region of space. In this essay, we explore the viewpoint that quantum field theory may emerge from an underlying theory that is locally finite-dimensional, and we construct a locally finite-dimensional version of a Klein-Gordon scalar field using generalized Clifford algebras. Demanding that the finite-dimensional field operators obey a suitable version of the canonical commutation relations makes this construction essentially unique. We then find that enforcing local finite dimensionality in a holographically consistent way leads to a huge suppression of the quantum contribution to vacuum energy, to the point that the theoretical prediction becomes plausibly consistent with observations.</p>},

We observe a fourth-order two photon virtual process between bound states indicating strong coupling between the photonic crystal and qubits.

	year = {2019},
	month = {03/20/2019},
	abstract = {<p>Neural networks have been criticized for their lack of easy interpretation, which undermines confidence in their use for important applications. Here, we introduce a novel technique, interpreting a trained neural network by investigating its flip points. A flip point is any point that lies on the boundary between two output classes: e.g. for a neural network with a binary yes/no output, a flip point is any input that generates equal scores for \&quot;yes\&quot; and \&quot;no\&quot;. The flip point closest to a given input is of particular importance, and this point is the solution to a well-posed optimization problem. This paper gives an overview of the uses of flip points and how they are computed. Through results on standard datasets, we demonstrate how flip points can be used to provide detailed interpretation of the output produced by a neural network. Moreover, for a given input, flip points enable us to measure confidence in the correctness of outputs much more effectively than softmax score. They also identify influential features of the inputs, identify bias, and find changes in the input that change the output of the model. We show that distance between an input and the closest flip point identifies the most influential points in the training data. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and rank-revealing QR factorization (RR-QR), the set of directions from each training input to its closest flip point provides explanations of how a trained neural network processes an entire dataset: what features are most important for classification into a given class, which features are most responsible for particular misclassifications, how an adversary might fool the network, etc. Although we investigate flip points for neural networks, their usefulness is actually model-agnostic.</p>},

So far, finding exact points on the decision boundaries of trained deep models has been considered an intractable problem. Here, we compute exact points on the decision boundaries of these models and provide mathematical tools to investigate the surfaces that define the decision boundaries. Through numerical results, we confirm that some of the speculations about the decision boundaries are accurate, some of the computational methods can be improved, and some of the simplifying assumptions may be unreliable, for models with nonlinear activation functions. We advocate for verification of simplifying assumptions and approximation methods, wherever they are used. Finally, we demonstrate that the computational practices used for finding adversarial examples can be improved and computing the closest point on the decision boundary reveals the weakest vulnerability of a model against adversarial attack.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are a framework for exact or approximate optimization that have widespread application in quantum information theory. We introduce a new method for using reductions to construct integrality gaps for SDPs. These are based on new limitations on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy in approximating two particularly important sets in quantum information theory, where previously no ω(1)-round integrality gaps were known: the set of separable (i.e. unentangled) states, or equivalently, the 2\&rarr;4 norm of a matrix, and the set of quantum correlations; i.e. conditional probability distributions achievable with local measurements on a shared entangled state. In both cases no-go theorems were previously known based on computational assumptions such as the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) which asserts that 3-SAT requires exponential time to solve. Our unconditional results achieve the same parameters as all of these previous results (for separable states) or as some of the previous results (for quantum correlations). In some cases we can make use of the framework of Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer (LRS) to establish integrality gaps for any SDP, not only the SoS hierarchy. Our hardness result on separable states also yields a dimension lower bound of approximate disentanglers, answering a question of Watrous and Aaronson et al. These results can be viewed as limitations on the monogamy principle, the PPT test, the ability of Tsirelson-type bounds to restrict quantum correlations, as well as the SDP hierarchies of Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri, Navascues-Pironio-Acin and Berta-Fawzi-Scholz.</p>},

To bound the error of the approximation, we use a known Lieb-Robinson bound that is weaker than the bound we establish. This result brings the analysis full circle, suggesting a deep connection between Lieb-Robinson bounds and digital quantum simulation. In addition to the new Lieb-Robinson bound, our analysis also gives an error bound for the Haah et al. quantum simulation algorithm when used to simulate power-law decaying interactions.

	abstract = {<p>Thermalization of chaotic quantum many-body systems under unitary time evolution is related to the growth in complexity of initially simple Heisenberg operators. Operator growth is a manifestation of information scrambling and can be diagnosed by out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). However, the behavior of OTOCs of local operators in generic chaotic local Hamiltonians remains poorly understood, with some semiclassical and large N models exhibiting exponential growth of OTOCs and a sharp chaos wavefront and other random circuit models showing a diffusively broadened wavefront. In this paper we propose a unified physical picture for scrambling in chaotic local Hamiltonians. We construct a random time-dependent Hamiltonian model featuring a large N limit where the OTOC obeys a Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) type equation and exhibits exponential growth and a sharp wavefront. We show that quantum fluctuations manifest as noise (distinct from the randomness of the couplings in the underlying Hamiltonian) in the FKPP equation and that the noise-averaged OTOC exhibits a cross-over to a diffusively broadened wavefront. At small N we demonstrate that operator growth dynamics, averaged over the random couplings, can be efficiently simulated for all time using matrix product state techniques. To show that time-dependent randomness is not essential to our conclusions, we push our previous matrix product operator methods to very large size and show that data for a time-independent Hamiltonian model are also consistent with a diffusively-broadened wavefront.</p>},

Otherwise, the momentum-space entanglement entropy is found to rapidly saturate.

	abstract = {<p>The Dicke model famously exhibits a phase transition to a superradiant phase with a macroscopic population of photons and is realized in multiple settings in open quantum systems. In this work, we study a variant of the Dicke model where the cavity mode is lossy due to the coupling to a Markovian environment while the atomic mode is coupled to a colored bath. We analytically investigate this model by inspecting its low-frequency behavior via the Schwinger-Keldysh field theory and carefully examine the nature of the corresponding superradiant phase transition. Integrating out the fast modes, we can identify a simple effective theory allowing us to derive analytical expressions for various critical exponents, including those, such as the dynamical critical exponent, that have not been previously considered. We find excellent agreement with previous numerical results when the non-Markovian bath is at zero temperature; however, contrary to these studies, our low-frequency approach reveals that the same exponents govern the critical behavior when the colored bath is at finite temperature unless the chemical potential is zero. Furthermore, we show that the superradiant phase transition is classical in nature, while it is genuinely non-equilibrium. We derive a fractional Langevin equation and conjecture the associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation that capture the system\&$\#$39;s long-time memory as well as its non-equilibrium behavior.

In strong \&quot;quantum access\&quot; security models, numerous symmetric-key cryptosystems are also vulnerable. We consider classical encryption in a model which grants the adversary quantum oracle access to encryption and decryption, but where the latter is restricted to non-adaptive (i.e., pre-challenge) queries only. We define this model formally using appropriate notions of ciphertext indistinguishability and semantic security (which are equivalent by standard arguments) and call it QCCA1 in analogy to the classical CCA1 security model. Using a bound on quantum random-access codes, we show that the standard PRF- and PRP-based encryption schemes are QCCA1-secure when instantiated with quantum-secure primitives. We then revisit standard IND-CPA-secure Learning with Errors (LWE) encryption and show that leaking just one quantum decryption query (and no other queries or leakage of any kind) allows the adversary to recover the full secret key with constant success probability. In the classical setting, by contrast, recovering the key uses a linear number of decryption queries, and this is optimal. The algorithm at the core of our attack is a (large-modulus version of) the well-known Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. We emphasize that our results should *not* be interpreted as a weakness of these cryptosystems in their stated security setting (i.e., post-quantum chosen-plaintext secrecy). Rather, our results mean that, if these cryptosystems are exposed to chosen-ciphertext attacks (e.g., as a result of deployment in an inappropriate real-world setting) then quantum attacks are even more devastating than classical ones.\&nbsp;</span></p>},

These number-theoretic characterizations shed new light upon the structure of Clifford+T circuits and led to remarkable developments in the field of quantum compiling.

Here, we report the first observation of magnetic domain wall confinement in interacting spin chains with a trapped-ion quantum simulator. By measuring how correlations spread, we show that confinement can dramatically suppress information propagation and thermalization in such many-body systems.

This problem has seen abundant activity in the last few years, particularly with the advent of parallel self-testing (i.e., testing several copies of a state at once), which has applications not only to quantum cryptography but also quantum computing. In this work we give the first error-tolerant parallel self-test in a three-party (rather than two-party) scenario, by showing that an arbitrary number of copies of the GHZ state can be self-tested. In order to handle the additional complexity of a three-party setting, we use a diagrammatic proof based on categorical quantum mechanics, rather than a typical symbolic proof. The diagrammatic approach allows for manipulations of the complicated tensor networks that arise in the proof, and gives a demonstration of the importance of picture-languages in quantum information.</p>},

Here, we show that by engineering dissipators containing photon pair operators, one can stabilize an exotic dark state, which is a condensate of photon pairs with a phase-nematic order. In this system, the usual superfluid order parameter, i.e. single-photon correlation, is absent, while the photon pair correlation exhibits long-range order. Although the dark state is not unique due to multiple parity sectors, we devise an additional type of dissipators to stabilize the dark state in a particular parity sector via a diffusive annihilation process which obeys Glauber dynamics in an Ising model. Furthermore, we propose an implementation of these photon-pair dissipators in circuit-QED architecture.\&nbsp;</p>},

Due to the large amount of symmetry in these potentials such problems are readily open to analysis both analytically and computationally. However, more realistic potentials do not have such a high degree of symmetry and may have many local minima. Here we present a somewhat more realistic class of problems consisting of many individually Hamming symmetric potential wells. For two or three such wells we demonstrate that such a problem can be solved exactly in time polynomial in the number of qubits and wells. For greater than three wells, we present a tight binding approach with which to efficiently analyze the performance of such Hamiltonians in an adiabatic computation. We provide several basic examples designed to highlight the usefulness of this toy model and to give insight into using the tight binding approach to examining it, including: (1) adiabatic unstructured search with a transverse field driver and a prior guess to the marked item and (2) a scheme for adiabatically simulating the ground states of small collections of strongly interacting spins, with an explicit demonstration for an Ising model Hamiltonian.</span></p>},

The measurement of quench dynamics, on the other hand, is now a routine practice in most cold atom platforms. Here we show that quintessential ingredients of quantum phase transitions can be probed directly with quench dynamics in integrable and nearly integrable systems. As a paradigmatic example, we study global quench dynamics in a transverse-field Ising model with either short-range or long-range interactions. When the model is integrable, we discover a new dynamical critical point with a non-analytic signature in the short-range correlators. The location of the dynamical critical point matches that of the quantum critical point and can be identified using a finite-time scaling method. We extend this scaling picture to systems near integrability and demonstrate the continued existence of a dynamical critical point detectable at prethermal time scales. Therefore, our method can be used to approximately locate the quantum critical point. The scaling method is also relevant to experiments with finite time and system size, and our predictions are testable in near-term experiments with trapped ions and Rydberg atoms.</p>},

A quantum computer, by contrast, would make many of these calculations feasible in principle, but it is still non-trivial to prepare a given thermal state or sample from it. It is also not known how to prepare special simple purifications of thermal states known as thermofield doubles, which play an important role in quantum many-body physics and quantum gravity. To address this problem, we propose a variational scheme to prepare approximate thermal states on a quantum computer by applying a series of two-qubit gates to a product mixed state. We apply our method to a non-integrable region of the mixed field Ising chain and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We also demonstrate how our method can be easily extended to large systems governed by local Hamiltonians and the preparation of thermofield double states. By comparing our results with exact solutions, we find that our construction enables the efficient preparation of approximate thermal states on quantum devices. Our results can be interpreted as implying that the details of the many-body energy spectrum are not needed to capture simple thermal observables.</p>},

By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated in ways that give rise to long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields. Here we review the theoretical mapping of atomic ions to interacting spin systems, the experimental preparation of complex equilibrium states, and the study of dynamical processes of this many-body interacting quantum system.

Motivated by this necessity, we develop a resource theory for magic quantum channels to characterize and quantify the quantum \&quot;magic\&quot; or non-stabilizerness of noisy quantum circuits. For qudit quantum computing with odd dimension d, it is known that quantum states with non-negative Wigner function can be efficiently simulated classically. First, inspired by this observation, we introduce a resource theory based on completely positive-Wigner-preserving quantum operations as free operations, and we show that they can be efficiently simulated via a classical algorithm. Second, we introduce two efficiently computable magic measures for quantum channels, called the mana and thauma of a quantum channel. As applications, we show that these measures not only provide fundamental limits on the distillable magic of quantum channels, but they also lead to lower bounds for the task of synthesizing non-Clifford gates. Third, we propose a classical algorithm for simulating noisy quantum circuits, whose sample complexity can be quantified by the mana of a quantum channel. We further show that this algorithm can outperform another approach for simulating noisy quantum circuits, based on channel robustness. Finally, we explore the threshold of non-stabilizerness for basic quantum circuits under depolarizing noise.</p>},

However, a rigorous understanding of its success and precise relation to the continuum is still lacking. To address this challenge, we provide an explicit construction of entanglement-renormalization quantum circuits that rigorously approximate correlation functions of the massless Dirac conformal field theory. We directly target the continuum theory: discreteness is introduced by our choice of how to probe the system, not by any underlying short-distance lattice regulator. To achieve this, we use multiresolution analysis from wavelet theory to obtain an approximation scheme and to implement entanglement renormalization in a natural way. This could be a starting point for constructing quantum circuit approximations for more general conformal field theories.\&nbsp;</p>},

Accordingly, we articulate a view towards quantum computation and quantum information science, where algorithms have demonstrated potential polynomial and exponential computational speedups in certain applications, such as machine learning. The maturation of the field of quantum computing, in hardware and algorithm development, also coincides with the growth of several collaborative efforts to address questions across length and time scales, and scientific disciplines. We use this coincidence to explore the potential for quantum computing to aid in one such endeavor: the merging of insights from genetics, genomics, neuroimaging and behavioral phenotyping. By examining joint opportunities for computational innovation across fields, we highlight the need for a common language between biological data analysis and quantum computing.

These protocols exhibit similar behavior to that seen in recent traversable wormhole constructions: information that is scrambled into one half of an entangled system will, following a weak coupling between the two halves, unscramble into the other half. We introduce the concept of \&quot;teleportation by size\&quot; to capture how the physics of operator-size growth naturally leads to information transmission. The transmission of a signal through a semi-classical holographic wormhole corresponds to a rather special property of the operator-size distribution we call \&quot;size winding\&quot;. For more general setups (which may not have a clean emergent geometry), we argue that imperfect size winding is a generalization of the traversable wormhole phenomenon. For example, a form of signalling continues to function at high temperature and at large times for generic chaotic systems, even though it does not correspond to a signal going through a geometrical wormhole, but rather to an interference effect involving macroscopically different emergent geometries. Finally, we outline implementations feasible with current technology in two experimental platforms: Rydberg atom arrays and trapped ions.\&nbsp;</span></p>},

AC0), the class of constant-depth and polynomial-sized circuits with unbounded fan-in majority gates (resp. AND, OR, NOT gates). We show that if there exists no quantum polynomial-time (resp. sub-exponential time) algorithm to solve the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, then there exists no polynomial-time quantum learning algorithm for TC0 (resp. AC0) under the uniform distribution (even with access to quantum membership queries). The main technique in this result uses explicit pseudo-random generators that are believed to be quantum-secure to construct concept classes that are hard to learn quantumly under the uniform distribution. 2) Hardness of learning TC02 in the PAC setting. Our second result shows that if there exists no quantum polynomial time algorithm for the LWE problem, then there exists no polynomial time quantum PAC learning algorithm for the class TC02, i.e., depth-2 TC0 circuits.

Tight bounds on the number of samples to estimate these entropies have been established in the classical setting, while little is known about their quantum counterparts. In this paper, we give the first quantum algorithms for estimating α- R\&acute;enyi entropies (Shannon entropy being 1-Renyi entropy). In particular, we demonstrate a quadratic quantum speedup for Shannon entropy estimation and a generic quantum speedup for α-R\&acute;enyi entropy estimation for all α \&ge; 0, including a tight bound for the collision-entropy (2-R\&acute;enyi entropy). We also provide quantum upper bounds for extreme cases such as the Hartley entropy (i.e., the logarithm of the support size of a distribution, corresponding to α = 0) and the min-entropy case (i.e., α = +\&infin;), as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions. Moreover, we complement our results with quantum lower bounds on α-R\&acute;enyi entropy estimation for all α \&ge; 0. Our approach is inspired by the pioneering work of Bravyi, Harrow, and Hassidim (BHH) [13] on quantum algorithms for distributional property testing, however, with many new technical ingredients. For Shannon entropy and 0-R\&acute;enyi entropy estimation, we improve the performance of the BHH framework, especially its error dependence, using Montanaro\&rsquo;s approach to estimating the expected output value of a quantum subroutine with bounded variance [41] and giving a fine-tuned error analysis. For general α-R\&acute;enyi entropy estimation, we further develop a procedure that recursively approximates α-R\&acute;enyi entropy for a sequence of αs, which is in spirit similar to a cooling schedule in simulated annealing. For special cases such as integer α \&ge; 2 and α = +\&infin; (i.e., the min-entropy), we reduce the entropy estimation problem to the α-distinctness and the dlog ne-distinctness problems, respectively. We exploit various techniques to obtain our lower bounds for different ranges of α, including reductions to (variants of) existing lower bounds in quantum query complexity as well as the polynomial method inspired by the celebrated quantum lower bound for the collision problem.</p>},

Coherent Coulomb interaction between ions is utilized to transfer quantum information between the communication and memory ions and to achieve entanglement swapping between two memory ions. We describe simple modular quantum repeater architectures realizable with the ion-trap modules and numerically study the dependence of the quantum key distribution rate on various experimental parameters, including coupling efficiency, gate infidelity, operation time and length of the elementary links. Our analysis suggests crucial improvements necessary in a physical implementation for co-trapped two-species ions to be a competitive platform in long-distance quantum communication.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum simulators are a promising technology on the spectrum of quantum devices from specialized quantum experiments to universal quantum computers. These quantum devices utilize entanglement and many-particle behaviors to explore and solve hard scientific, engineering, and computational problems. Rapid development over the last two decades has produced more than 300 quantum simulators in operation worldwide using a wide variety of experimental platforms. Recent advances in several physical architectures promise a golden age of quantum simulators ranging from highly optimized special purpose simulators to flexible programmable devices. These developments have enabled a convergence of ideas drawn from fundamental physics, computer science, and device engineering. They have strong potential to address problems of societal importance, ranging from understanding vital chemical processes, to enabling the design of new materials with enhanced performance, to solving complex computational problems. It is the position of the community, as represented by participants of the NSF workshop on \&quot;Programmable Quantum Simulators,\&quot; that investment in a national quantum simulator program is a high priority in order to accelerate the progress in this field and to result in the first practical applications of quantum machines. Such a program should address two areas of emphasis: (1) support for creating quantum simulator prototypes usable by the broader scientific community, complementary to the present universal quantum computer effort in industry; and (2) support for fundamental research carried out by a blend of multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary collaborations with resources for quantum simulator software, hardware, and education.\&nbsp;</p>},

Inspired by previous studies on the adversarial training of classical and quantum generative models, we propose the first design of quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), which has been shown to improve the robustness and the scalability of the adversarial training of quantum generative models even on noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, we propose a definition of the Wasserstein semimetric between quantum data, which inherits a few key theoretical merits of its classical counterpart. We also demonstrate how to turn the quantum Wasserstein semimetric into a concrete design of quantum WGANs that can be efficiently implemented on quantum machines. Our numerical study, via classical simulation of quantum systems, shows the more robust and scalable numerical performance of our quantum WGANs over other quantum GAN proposals. As a surprising application, our quantum WGAN has been used to generate a 3-qubit quantum circuit of ~50 gates that well approximates a 3-qubit 1-d Hamiltonian simulation circuit that requires over 10k gates using standard techniques.</p>},

	year = {2019},
	abstract = {<p>Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a central topic in mathematical optimization with extensive studies on its efficient solvers. Recently, quantum algorithms with superpolynomial speedups for solving SDPs have been proposed assuming access to its constraint matrices in quantum superposition. Mutually inspired by both classical and quantum SDP solvers, in this paper we present a sublinear classical algorithm for solving low-rank SDPs which is asymptotically as good as existing quantum algorithms. Specifically, given an SDP with m constraint matrices, each of dimension n and rank poly(logn), our algorithm gives a succinct description and any entry of the solution matrix in time O(m\&sdot;poly(logn,1/ε)) given access to a sample-based low-overhead data structure of the constraint matrices, where ε is the precision of the solution. In addition, we apply our algorithm to a quantum state learning task as an application. Technically, our approach aligns with both the SDP solvers based on the matrix multiplicative weight (MMW) framework and the recent studies of quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms. The cost of solving SDPs by MMW mainly comes from the exponentiation of Hermitian matrices, and we propose two new technical ingredients (compared to previous sample-based algorithms) for this task that may be of independent interest: . Weighted sampling: assuming sampling access to each individual constraint matrix A1,\&hellip;,Aτ, we propose a procedure that gives a good approximation of A=A1+...+Aτ. . Symmetric approximation: we propose a sampling procedure that gives low-rank spectral decomposition of a Hermitian matrix A. This improves upon previous sampling procedures that only give low-rank singular value decompositions, losing the signs of eigenvalues.</p>},

In this respect, such models more closely resemble spin glasses. We demonstrate this by two means: first, a general theorem proving that the annealed free energy is divergent at low temperature in any model with a tensor product Hilbert space; and second, a replica treatment of two prominent examples which exhibit phase transitions from an \&quot;annealed\&quot; phase to a \&quot;non-annealed\&quot; phase as a function of temperature. We further show that this effect appears only at O(N)\&$\#$39;th order in a 1/N expansion, even though lower-order terms misleadingly seem to converge. Our results prove that the non-bosonic nature of the particles in SYK is an essential ingredient for its physics, highlight connections between local models and spin glasses, and raise important questions as to the role of fermions and/or glassiness in holography.</p>},

Here, we show that this process can also be observed in quantum Ising chains where domain walls get confined either by a symmetry-breaking field or by long-range interactions. We find that string breaking occurs, in general, as a two-stage process: First, the initial charges remain essentially static and stable. The connecting string, however, can become a dynamical object. We develop an effective description of this motion, which we find is strongly constrained. In the second stage, which can be severely delayed due to these dynamical constraints, the string finally breaks. We observe that the associated time scale can depend crucially on the initial separation between domain walls and can grow by orders of magnitude by changing the distance by just a few lattice sites. We discuss how our results generalize to one-dimensional confining gauge theories and how they can be made accessible in quantum simulator experiments such as Rydberg atoms or trapped ions.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>Deep learning models have proven to be exceptionally useful in performing many machine learning tasks. However, for each new dataset, choosing an effective size and structure of the model can be a time-consuming process of trial and error. While a small network with few neurons might not be able to capture the intricacies of a given task, having too many neurons can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. Here, we propose a practical method that employs matrix conditioning to automatically design the structure of layers of a feed-forward network, by first adjusting the proportion of neurons among the layers of a network and then scaling the size of network up or down. Results on sample image and non-image datasets demonstrate that our method results in small networks with high accuracies. Finally, guided by matrix conditioning, we provide a method to effectively squeeze models that are already trained. Our techniques reduce the human cost of designing deep learning models and can also reduce training time and the expense of using neural networks for applications.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>This paper develops the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability for quantum channels, generalizing the related resource theory for states [arXiv:1006.0302, arXiv:1905.11629]. The key constituents of the channel resource theory are quantum channel boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum channels, which can be manipulated for free by means of an arbitrary quantum superchannel (the most general physical transformation of a quantum channel). One main question of the resource theory is the approximate channel box transformation problem, in which the goal is to transform an initial channel box (or boxes) to a final channel box (or boxes), while allowing for an asymmetric error in the transformation. The channel resource theory is richer than its counterpart for states because there is a wider variety of ways in which this question can be framed, either in the one-shot or n-shot regimes, with the latter having parallel and sequential variants. As in [arXiv:1905.11629], we consider two special cases of the general channel box transformation problem, known as distinguishability distillation and dilution. For the one-shot case, we find that the optimal values of the various tasks are equal to the non-smooth or smooth channel min- or max-relative entropies, thus endowing all of these quantities with operational interpretations. In the asymptotic sequential setting, we prove that the exact distinguishability cost is equal to channel max-relative entropy and the distillable distinguishability is equal to the amortized channel relative entropy of [arXiv:1808.01498]. This latter result can also be understood as a solution to Stein\&$\#$39;s lemma for quantum channels in the sequential setting. Finally, the theory simplifies significantly for environment-seizable and classical--quantum channel boxes.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The traditional perspective in quantum resource theories concerns how to use free operations to convert one resourceful quantum state to another one. For example, a fundamental and well known question in entanglement theory is to determine the distillable entanglement of a bipartite state, which is equal to the maximum rate at which fresh Bell states can be distilled from many copies of a given bipartite state by employing local operations and classical communication for free. It is the aim of this paper to take this kind of question to the next level, with the main question being: What is the best way of using free channels to convert one resourceful quantum channel to another? Here we focus on the the resource theory of entanglement for bipartite channels and establish several fundamental tasks and results regarding it. In particular, we establish bounds on several pertinent information processing tasks in channel entanglement theory, and we define several entanglement measures for bipartite channels, including the logarithmic negativity and the κ-entanglement. We also show that the max-Rains information of [B{\"a}uml et al., Physical Review Letters, 121, 250504 (2018)] has a divergence interpretation, which is helpful for simplifying the results of this earlier work.\&nbsp;</p>},

However, state preparation via MERA typically requires the advent of a full-fledged universal quantum computer.

From the practical point of view, when reliable quantum computers are eventually built, these algorithms can help us better understand the underlying physics that govern our world. In the best known quantum algorithms for simulating quantum field theories, the time scaling is dominated by initial state preparation. In this paper, we exclusively focus on state preparation and present a heuristic algorithm that can prepare the vacuum of fermionic systems in more general cases and more efficiently than previous methods. With our method, state preparation is no longer the bottleneck, as its runtime has the same asymptotic scaling with the desired precision as the remainder of the simulation algorithm.

	abstract = {<p>We present a general theory of quantum information propagation in chaotic quantum many-body systems. The generic expectation in such systems is that quantum information does not propagate in localized form; instead, it tends to spread out and scramble into a form that is inaccessible to local measurements. To characterize this spreading, we define an information speed via a quench-type experiment and derive a general formula for it as a function of the entanglement density of the initial state. As the entanglement density varies from zero to one, the information speed varies from the entanglement speed to the butterfly speed. We verify that the formula holds both for a quantum chaotic spin chain and in field theories with an AdS/CFT gravity dual. For the second case, we study in detail the dynamics of entanglement in two-sided Vaidya-AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom black branes. We also show that, with an appropriate decoding process, quantum information can be construed as moving at the information speed, and, in the case of AdS/CFT, we show that a locally detectable signal propagates at the information speed in a spatially local variant of the traversable wormhole setup.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Ion trap systems are a leading platform for large scale quantum computers. Trapped ion qubit crystals are fully-connected and reconfigurable, owing to their long range Coulomb interaction that can be modulated with external optical forces. However, the spectral crowding of collective motional modes could pose a challenge to the control of such interactions for large numbers of qubits. Here, we show that high-fidelity quantum gate operations are still possible with very large trapped ion crystals, simplifying the scaling of ion trap quantum computers. To this end, we present analytical work that determines how parallel entangling gates produce a crosstalk error that falls off as the inverse cube of the distance between the pairs. We also show experimental work demonstrating entangling gates on a fully-connected chain of seventeen 171Yb+ ions with fidelities as high as 97(1)\%.</p>},

While low-depth quantum algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigenvalue solver (VQE), have been used to determine ground state energies, methods for calculating excited states currently involve the implementation of high-depth controlled-unitaries or a large number of additional samples. Here we show how overlap estimation can be used to deflate eigenstates once they are found, enabling the calculation of excited state energies and their degeneracies. We propose an implementation that requires the same number of qubits as VQE and at most twice the circuit depth. Our method is robust to control errors, is compatible with error-mitigation strategies and can be implemented on near-term quantum compute</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The logarithmic negativity of a bipartite quantum state is a widely employed entanglement measure in quantum information theory, due to the fact that it is easy to compute and serves as an upper bound on distillable entanglement. More recently, the κ-entanglement of a bipartite state was shown to be the first entanglement measure that is both easily computable and operationally meaningful, being equal to the exact entanglement cost of a bipartite quantum state when the free operations are those that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose. In this paper, we provide a non-trivial link between these two entanglement measures, by showing that they are the extremes of an ordered family of α-logarithmic negativity entanglement measures, each of which is identified by a parameter α\&isin;[1,\&infin;]. In this family, the original logarithmic negativity is recovered as the smallest with α=1, and the κ-entanglement is recovered as the largest with α=\&infin;. We prove that the α-logarithmic negativity satisfies the following properties: entanglement monotone, normalization, faithfulness, and subadditivity. We also prove that it is neither convex nor monogamous. Finally, we define the α-logarithmic negativity of a quantum channel as a generalization of the notion for quantum states, and we show how to generalize many of the concepts to arbitrary resource theories.\&nbsp;</p>},

Efforts to thwart this uninteresting fixed point include adding sufficient disorder to realize a Floquet many-body localized phase or working in a narrow region of drive frequencies to achieve glassy non-thermal behavior at long time. Here we show that in clean systems the Floquet eigenstates can exhibit non-thermal behavior due to finite system size. We consider a one-dimensional system of spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor interactions where the interaction term is driven. Interestingly, even with no static component of the interaction, the quasienergy spectrum contains gaps and a significant fraction of the Floquet eigenstates, at all quasienergies, have non-thermal average doublon densities. We show that this non-thermal behavior arises due to emergent integrability at large interaction strength and discuss how the integrability breaks down with power-law behavior in system size.</p>},

Such asymmetric dynamics is in sharp contrast with the dynamics of conventional fermions or bosons, where both the transport and information dynamics are spatially symmetric.

Our autonomous design implements a Carnot cycle, relies solely on standard thermal baths and can be implemented with circuit quantum electrodynamics.

We propose a graph-theoretic approach to efficiently produce Bell monogamy relations in arbitrary arrangements of qubits. All the relations obtained for bipartite Bell inequalities are tight and leverage only a single Bell monogamy relation. This feature is unique to bipartite Bell inequalities, as we show that there is no finite set of such elementary monogamy relations for multipartite inequalities. Nevertheless, many tight monogamy relations for multipartite inequalities can be obtained with our method as shown in explicit examples.</span></p>},

We study the time-dependent physics of this behind-the-horizon region, whose ETW boundary geometry takes the form of a closed FRW spacetime. We show that in many cases, this behind-the-horizon physics can be probed directly by looking at the time dependence of entanglement entropy for sufficiently large spatial CFT subsystems. We study in particular states defined via Euclidean evolution from conformal boundary states and give specific predictions for the behavior of the entanglement entropy in this case. We perform analogous calculations for the SYK model and find qualitative agreement with our expectations. A fascinating possibility is that for certain states, we might have gravity localized to the ETW brane as in the Randall-Sundrum II scenario for cosmology. In this case, the effective description of physics beyond the horizon could be a big bang/big crunch cosmology of the same dimensionality as the CFT. In this case, the d-dimensional CFT describing the black hole microstate would give a precise, microscopic description of the d-dimensional cosmological physics.\&nbsp;</p>},

In the classical setting, blind computations protect the data or even the program run by a server. In the quantum regime, blind computing may also enable testing computational or other quantum properties of the server system. Here we propose a scheme for universal blind quantum computation using a quantum simulator capable of emulating Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians. Our scheme is inspired by the central spin Hamiltonian in which a single spin controls dynamics of a number of bath spins. We show how, by manipulating this spin, a client that only accesses the central spin can effectively perform blind computation on the bath spins. Remarkably, two-way quantum communication mediated by the central spin is sufficient to ensure security in the scheme. Finally, we provide explicit examples of how our universal blind quantum computation enables verification of the power of the server from classical to stabilizer to full BQP computation.</span></p>},

Photons, one of the most prominent species of bosons, do not typically condense due to the lack of a particle number-conservation. We recently described a photon thermalization mechanism which gives rise to a grand canonical ensemble of light with effective photon number conservation between a subsystem and a particle reservoir. This mechanism occurs during Doppler laser cooling of atoms where the atoms serve as a temperature reservoir while the cooling laser photons serve as a particle reservoir. Here we address the question of the possibility of a BEC of photons in this laser cooling photon thermalization scenario and theoretically demonstrate that a Bose condensation of photons can be realized by cooling an ensemble of two-level atoms (realizable with alkaline earth atoms) inside a Fabry-Perot cavity.</p>},

Here we study a closely related quantum field-theoretical problem: estimating the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude, in the presence of spacetime-dependent classical sources, for a massive scalar field theory in (1+1) dimensions. We show that this problem is BQP-hard; in other words, its solution enables one to solve any problem that is solvable in polynomial time by a quantum computer. Hence, the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude cannot be accurately estimated by any efficient classical algorithm, even if the field theory is very weakly coupled, unless BQP=BPP. Furthermore, the corresponding decision problem can be solved by a quantum computer in a time scaling polynomially with the number of bits needed to specify the classical source fields, and this problem is therefore BQP-complete. Our construction can be regarded as an idealized architecture for a universal quantum computer in a laboratory system described by massive phi^4 theory coupled to classical spacetime-dependent sources.</span></p>},

This has been used to experimentally implement realizations of Mott insulator and Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transitions to vortex dynamics analogous to those in type-II superconductors. When an external magnetic field is added, the effective spins of the XY model become frustrated, leading to the formation of topological defects (vortices). Here we observe the many-body dynamics of such an array, including frustration, via its coupling to a superconducting microwave cavity. We take the design of the transmon qubit, but replace the single junction between two antenna pads with the complete array. This allows us to probe the system at 10 mK with minimal self-heating by using weak coherent states at the single (microwave) photon level to probe the resonance frequency of the cavity.

	abstract = {<p>There has been a recent surge of interest and progress in creating subwavelength free-space optical potentials for ultra-cold atoms. A key open question is whether geometric potentials, which are repulsive and ubiquitous in the creation of subwavelength free-space potentials, forbid the creation of narrow traps with long lifetimes. Here, we show that it is possible to create such traps. We propose two schemes for realizing subwavelength traps and demonstrate their superiority over existing proposals. We analyze the lifetime of atoms in such traps and show that long-lived bound states are possible. This work opens a new frontier for the subwavelength control and manipulation of ultracold matter, with applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation.</p>},

Although nearest-neighbour exchange coupling of two spins has been demonstrated, the interaction of spins via microwave-frequency photons could enable long-distance spin\&ndash;spin coupling and connections between arbitrary pairs of qubits (\&lsquo;all-to-all\&rsquo; connectivity) in a spin-based quantum processor. Realizing coherent spin\&ndash;photon coupling is challenging because of the small magnetic-dipole moment of a single spin, which limits magnetic-dipole coupling rates to less than 1 kilohertz. Here we demonstrate strong coupling between a single spin in silicon and a single microwave-frequency photon, with spin\&ndash;photon coupling rates of more than 10 megahertz. The mechanism that enables the coherent spin\&ndash;photon interactions is based on spin\&ndash;charge hybridization in the presence of a magnetic-field gradient. In addition to spin\&ndash;photon coupling, we demonstrate coherent control and dispersive readout of a single spin.

Our apparatus is based on a segmented-blade ion trap enclosed in a 4 K cryostat, which enables us to routinely trap over 100 171Yb+ ions in a linear configuration for hours due to a low background gas pressure from differential cryo-pumping. We characterize the cryogenic vacuum by using trapped ion crystals as a pressure gauge, measuring both inelastic and elastic collision rates with the molecular background gas. We demonstrate nearly equidistant ion spacing for chains of up to 44 ions using anharmonic axial potentials.

The players share an entangled pair of qubits and perform rotations on their qubit as the strategy choice. Two five-qubit circuits are sufficient to run all 16 possible strategy choice sets in a game with four possible strategies. The data are then parsed into player types randomly in order to combine them classically into a Bayesian framework. We exhaustively compute the possible strategies of the game so that the experimental data can be used to solve for the Nash equilibria of the game directly. Then we compare the payoff at the Nash equilibria and location of phase-change-like transitions obtained from the experimental data to the theory, and study how it changes as a function of the amount of entanglement.</span></p>},

This raises the question of whether classical Monte Carlo algorithms can efficiently simulate quantum adiabatic optimization with stoquastic Hamiltonians. Recent results have given counterexamples in which path integral and diffusion Monte Carlo fail to do so. However, most adiabatic optimization algorithms, such as for solving MAX-k-SAT problems, use k-local Hamiltonians, whereas our previous counterexample for diffusion Monte Carlo involved n-body interactions. Here we present a new 6-local counterexample which demonstrates that even for these local Hamiltonians there are cases where diffusion Monte Carlo cannot efficiently simulate quantum adiabatic optimization. Furthermore, we perform empirical testing of diffusion Monte Carlo on a standard well-studied class of permutation-symmetric tunneling problems and similarly find large advantages for quantum optimization over diffusion Monte Carlo.</span></p>},

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<p>The ultimate limits of performance for any classical optical system are set by sub-wavelength fluctuations within the host material, that may be frozen-in or even dynamically induced. The most common manifestation of such sub-wavelength disorder is Rayleigh light scattering, which is observed in nearly all wave-guiding technologies today and can lead to both irreversible radiative losses as well as undesirable intermodal coupling. While it has been shown that backscattering from disorder can be suppressed by breaking time-reversal symmetry in magneto-optic and topological insulator materials, common optical dielectrics possess neither of these properties. Here we demonstrate an optomechanical approach for dynamically suppressing Rayleigh backscattering within dielectric resonators. We achieve this by locally breaking time-reversal symmetry in a silica resonator through a Brillouin scattering interaction that is available in all materials. Near-complete suppression of Rayleigh backscattering is experimentally confirmed through three independent measurements -- the reduction of the back-reflections caused by scatterers, the elimination of a commonly seen normal-mode splitting effect, and by measurement of the reduction in intrinsic optical loss. More broadly, our results provide new evidence that it is possible to dynamically suppress Rayleigh backscattering within any optical dielectric medium, for achieving robust light propagation in nanophotonic devices in spite of the presence of scatterers or defects.</p>},

Further, we show that systems in the Anderson-localized phase are always easy to sample from at arbitrarily long times.

Here, we report up-conversion of a radio-frequency NMR signal to an optical regime using a high-stress silicon nitride membrane that interfaces the electrical detection circuit and an optical cavity through the electro-mechanical and the opto-mechanical couplings. This enables optical NMR detection without sacrificing the versatility of the traditional nuclear induction approach. While the signal-to-noise ratio is currently limited by the Brownian motion of the membrane as well as additional technical noise, we find it can exceed that of the conventional electrical schemes by increasing the electro-mechanical coupling strength. The electro-mechano-optical NMR detection presented here can even be combined with the laser cooling technique applied to nuclear spins.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>Using the techniques of optomechanics, a high-Q mechanical oscillator may serve as a link between electromagnetic modes of vastly different frequencies. This approach has successfully been exploited for the frequency conversion of classical signals and has the potential of performing quantum state transfer between superconducting circuitry and a traveling optical signal. Such transducers are often operated in a linear regime, where the hybrid system can be described using linear response theory based on the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. While mathematically straightforward to solve, this approach yields little intuition about the dynamics of the hybrid system to aid the optimization of the transducer. As an analysis and design tool for such electro-optomechanical transducers, we introduce an equivalent circuit formalism, where the entire transducer is represented by an electrical circuit. Thereby we integrate the transduction functionality of optomechanical (OM) systems into the toolbox of electrical engineering allowing the use of its well-established design techniques. This unifying impedance description can be applied both for static (DC) and harmonically varying (AC) drive fields, accommodates arbitrary linear circuits, and is not restricted to the resolved-sideband regime. Furthermore, by establishing the quantized input/output formalism for the equivalent circuit, we obtain the scattering matrix for linear transducers using circuit analysis, and thereby have a complete quantum mechanical characterization of the transducer. Hence, this mapping of the entire transducer to the language of electrical engineering both sheds light on how the transducer performs and can at the same time be used to optimize its performance by aiding the design of a suitable electrical circuit.</p>},

In solid-state systems such quasiparticles, which are exemplified by neutral dipolar excitations, lead to long-range correlations of local observables and may dominate energy transport. Focussing on the excitations in disordered electronic systems, we compute the energy-level correlation function R2(ω) in a finite system in the limit of sufficiently strong disorder. At small energy differences the correlations exhibit Wigner-Dyson statistics. In particular, in the limit of very strong disorder the energy-level correlation function is given by R2(ω,V)=A3ωωV for small frequencies ω<<ωV and R2(ω,V)=1\&minus;(α\&minus;d)A1(ωVω)dα\&minus;A2(ωVω)2 for large frequencies ω>>ωV, where ωV\&prop;V\&minus;αd is the characteristic matrix element of excitation hopping in a system of volume V, and A1, A2 and A3 are coefficient of order unity which depend on the shape of the system. The energy-level correlation function, which we study, allows for a direct experimental observation, for example, by measuring the correlations of the ac conductance of the system at different frequencies.</p>},

This process is not unique, and in systems composed of many degrees of freedom, one natural purification is the one with minimal entanglement. Here we study the entropy of the minimally entangled purification, called the entanglement of purification, in three model systems: an Ising spin chain, conformal field theories holographically dual to Einstein gravity, and random stabilizer tensor networks. We conjecture values for the entanglement of purification in all these models, and we support our conjectures with a variety of numerical and analytical results. We find that such minimally entangled purifications have a number of applications, from enhancing entanglement-based tensor network methods for describing mixed states to elucidating novel aspects of the emergence of geometry from entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>From dice to modern complex circuits, there have been many attempts to build increasingly better devices to generate random numbers. Today, randomness is fundamental to security and cryptographic systems, as well as safeguarding privacy. A key challenge with random number generators is that it is hard to ensure that their outputs are unpredictable. For a random number generator based on a physical process, such as a noisy classical system or an elementary quantum measurement, a detailed model describing the underlying physics is required to assert unpredictability. Such a model must make a number of assumptions that may not be valid, thereby compromising the integrity of the device. However, it is possible to exploit the phenomenon of quantum nonlocality with a loophole-free Bell test to build a random number generator that can produce output that is unpredictable to any adversary limited only by general physical principles. With recent technological developments, it is now possible to carry out such a loophole-free Bell test. Here we present certified randomness obtained from a photonic Bell experiment and extract 1024 random bits uniform to within 10\&minus;12. These random bits could not have been predicted within any physical theory that prohibits superluminal signaling and allows one to make independent measurement choices. To certify and quantify the randomness, we describe a new protocol that is optimized for apparatuses characterized by a low per-trial violation of Bell inequalities. We thus enlisted an experimental result that fundamentally challenges the notion of determinism to build a system that can increase trust in random sources. In the future, random number generators based on loophole-free Bell tests may play a role in increasing the security and trust of our cryptographic systems and infrastructure.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>In quantum algorithms discovered so far for simulating scattering processes in quantum field theories, state preparation is the slowest step. We present a new algorithm for preparing particle states to use in simulation of Fermionic Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on a quantum computer, which is based on the matrix product state ansatz. We apply this to the massive Gross-Neveu model in one spatial dimension to illustrate the algorithm, but we believe the same algorithm with slight modifications can be used to simulate any one-dimensional massive Fermionic QFT. In the case where the number of particle species is one, our algorithm can prepare particle states using O(ε\&minus;3.23\&hellip;) gates, which is much faster than previous known results, namely O(ε\&minus;8\&minus;o(1)). Furthermore, unlike previous methods which were based on adiabatic state preparation, the method given here should be able to simulate quantum phases unconnected to the free theory.</p>},

We explore one of these fractal systems, weakly bound dysprosium lanthanide molecules, in an external magnetic field. As recently shown, colliding ultracold magnetic dysprosium atoms display a soft chaotic behavior with a small degree of disorder. We broaden this classification by investigating the generalized inverse participation ratio and fractal dimensions for large sets of molecular wave functions. Our exact close-coupling simulations reveal a dynamic phase transition from partially localized states to totally delocalized states and universality in its distribution by increasing the magnetic field strength to only a hundred Gauss (or 10 mT). Finally, we prove the existence of nonergodic delocalized phase in the system and explain the violation of ergodicity by strong coupling between near-threshold molecular states and the nearby continuum.</span></p>},

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<p>Highly tunable platforms for realizing topological phases of matter are emerging from atomic and photonic systems, and offer the prospect of designing interactions between particles. The shape of the potential, besides playing an important role in the competition between different fractional quantum Hall phases, can also trigger the transition to symmetry-broken phases, or even to phases where topological and symmetry-breaking order coexist. Here, we explore the phase diagram of an interacting bosonic model in the lowest Landau level at half-filling as two-body interactions are tuned. Apart from the well-known Laughlin liquid, Wigner crystal phase, stripe, and bubble phases, we also find evidence of a phase that exhibits crystalline order at fractional filling per crystal site. The Laughlin liquid transits into this phase when pairs of bosons strongly repel each other at relative angular momentum 4ℏ. We show that such interactions can be achieved by dressing ground-state cold atoms with multiple different-parity Rydberg states.</p>},

The relative strength of quantum and classical correlations is usually studied in the context of Bell inequalities, but this tells us little about the geometry of the quantum set of correlations. In other words, we do not have good intuition about what the quantum set actually looks like. In this paper we study the geometry of the quantum set using standard tools from convex geometry. We find explicit examples of rather counter-intuitive features in the simplest non-trivial Bell scenario (two parties, two inputs and two outputs) and illustrate them using 2-dimensional slice plots. We also show that even more complex features appear in Bell scenarios with more inputs or more parties. Finally, we discuss the limitations that the geometry of the quantum set imposes on the task of self-testing.</p>},

We partially match this behavior to simple tensor network models which can capture aspects of hyperscaling violation.

We focus on noiseless matrix sensing over rank-r positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices in Rn\&times;n, with a sensing mechanism that satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP). The algorithm we study is that of \emph{factored gradient descent}, where we model the low-rankness and PSD constraints with the factorization UU⊤, where U\&isin;Rn\&times;r. Surprisingly, recent work argues that the choice of r\&le;n is not pivotal: even setting U\&isin;Rn\&times;n is sufficient for factored gradient descent to find the rank-r solution, which suggests that operating over the factors leads to an implicit regularization. In this note, we provide a different perspective. We show that, in the noiseless case, under certain conditions, the PSD constraint by itself is sufficient to lead to a unique rank-r matrix recovery, without implicit or explicit low-rank regularization. \emph{I.e.}, under assumptions, the set of PSD matrices, that are consistent with the observed data, is a singleton, irrespective of the algorithm used.</p>},

If these reduced states defy classical explanation \&mdash; that is, if shared randomness cannot produce these reduced states for all possible measurements \&mdash; the bipartite state is said to be steerable. Determining which states are steerable is a challenging problem even for low dimensions. In the case of two-qubit systems a criterion is known for T-states (that is, those with maximally mixed marginals) under projective measurements. In the current work we introduce the concept of keyring models \&mdash; a special class of local hidden state model. When the measurements made correspond to real projectors, these allow us to study steerability beyond T-states. Using keyring models, we completely solve the steering problem for real projective measurements when the state arises from mixing a pure two-qubit state with uniform noise. We also give a partial solution in the case when the uniform noise is replaced by independent depolarizing channels. Our results imply that Werner states, which are a special case of the previous states, are unsteerable under real projective measurements if and only if their efficiency is at most 2/π.</p>},

We present a logical framework that captures two mathematical approaches to resource theory based on monoids (algebraic) and monoidal categories (categorical). We develop the syntax of this framework as an intuitionistic sequent calculus, and prove soundness and completeness of an algebraic and categorical semantics that recover these approaches.

	abstract = {<p>Contextuality is a necessary resource for universal quantum computation and non-contextual quantum mechanics can be simulated efficiently by classical computers in many cases. Orders of Planck\&$\#$39;s constant, ℏ, can also be used to characterize the classical-quantum divide by expanding quantities of interest in powers of ℏ---all orders higher than ℏ0 can be interpreted as quantum corrections to the order ℏ0 term. We show that contextual measurements in finite-dimensional systems have formulations within the Wigner-Weyl-Moyal (WWM) formalism that require higher than order ℏ0 terms to be included in order to violate the classical bounds on their expectation values. As a result, we show that contextuality as a resource is equivalent to orders of ℏ as a resource within the WWM formalism. This explains why qubits can only exhibit state-independent contextuality under Pauli observables as in the Peres-Mermin square while odd-dimensional qudits can also exhibit state-dependent contextuality. In particular, we find that qubit Pauli observables lack an order ℏ0 contribution in their Weyl symbol and so exhibit contextuality regardless of the state being measured. On the other hand, odd-dimensional qudit observables generally possess non-zero order ℏ0 terms, and higher, in their WWM formulation, and so exhibit contextuality depending on the state measured: odd-dimensional qudit states that exhibit measurement contextuality have an order ℏ1 contribution that allows for the violation of classical bounds while states that do not exhibit measurement contextuality have insufficiently large order ℏ1 contributions.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The problem of Oblivious RAM (ORAM) has traditionally been studied in a single-server setting, but more recently the multi-server setting has also been considered. Yet it is still unclear whether the multi-server setting has any inherent advantages, e.g., whether the multi-server setting can be used to achieve stronger security goals or provably better efficiency than is possible in the single-server case. In this work, we construct a perfectly secure 3-server ORAM scheme that outperforms the best known single-server scheme by a logarithmic factor. In the process, we also show, for the first time, that there exist specific algorithms for which multiple servers can overcome known lower bounds in the single-server setting.\&nbsp;</p>},

	abstract = {<p>One of the applications of quantum technology is to use quantum states and measurements to communicate which offers more reliable security promises. Quantum data hiding, which gives the source party the ability of sharing data among multiple receivers and revealing it at a later time depending on his/her will, is one of the promising information sharing schemes which may address practical security issues. In this work, we propose a novel quantum data hiding protocol. By concatenating different subprotocols which apply to rather symmetric hiding scenarios, we cover a variety of more general hiding scenarios. We provide the general requirements for constructing such protocols and give explicit examples of encoding states for five parties. We also proved the security of the protocol in sense that the achievable information by unauthorized operations asymptotically goes to zero. In addition, due to the capability of the sender to manipulate his/her subsystem, the sender is able to abort the protocol remotely at any time before he/she reveals the information.</p>},

This suggests that rather than Fock space states, one should use Faddeev-Kulish-type dressed states to correctly describe physical processes involving incoming superpositions.

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<p>We show that it is possible to construct a preparation non-contextual ontological model that does not exhibit \&quot;transformation contextuality\&quot; for single qubits in the stabilizer subtheory. In particular, we consider the \&quot;blowtorch\&quot; map and show that it does not exhibit transformation contextuality under the Grassmann Wigner-Weyl-Moyal (WWM) qubit formalism. Furthermore, the transformation in this formalism can be fully expressed at order ℏ0 and so does not qualify as a candidate quantum phenomenon. In particular, we find that the Grassmann WWM formalism at order ℏ0 corresponds to an ontological model governed by an additional set of constraints arising from the relations defining the Grassmann algebra. Due to this additional set of constraints, the allowed probability distributions in this model do not form a single convex set when expressed in terms of disjoint ontic states and so cannot be mapped to models whose states form a single convex set over disjoint ontic states. However, expressing the Grassmann WWM ontological model in terms of non-disjoint ontic states corresponding to the monomials of the Grassmann algebra results in a single convex set. We further show that a recent result by Lillystone et al. that proves a broad class of preparation and measurement non-contextual ontological models must exhibit transformation contextuality lacks the generality to include the ontological model considered here; Lillystone et al.\&$\#$39;s result is appropriately limited to ontological models whose states produce a single convex set when expressed in terms of disjoint ontic states. Therefore, we prove that for the qubit stabilizer subtheory to be captured by a preparation, transformation and measurement non-contextual ontological theory, it must be expressed in terms of non-disjoint ontic states, unlike the case for the odd-dimensional single-qudit stabilizer subtheory.</p>},

Here, we report on the direct observation of self-interaction by using a nano-eV atom collider to track the position of a magnetically-tunable Feshbach resonance through a parameter space spanned by energy and magnetic field.

In contrast, photons typically only weakly influence each other due to their very weak interactions and vanishing mass. We report the observation of traveling three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium where the interactions between photons are mediated by atomic Rydberg states. In particular, photon correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct features associated with three-photon and two-photon bound states. Such photonic trimers and dimers can be viewed as quantum solitons with shape-preserving wavefunctions that depend on the constituent photon number. The observed bunching and strongly nonlinear optical phase are quantitatively described by an effective field theory (EFT) of Rydberg-induced photon-photon interactions, which demonstrates the presence of a substantial effective three-body force between the photons. These observations pave the way towards the realization, studies, and control of strongly interacting quantum many-body states of light.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>A major application for atomic ensembles consists of a quantum memory for light, in which an optical state can be reversibly converted to a collective atomic excitation on demand. There exists a well-known fundamental bound on the storage error, when the ensemble is describable by a continuous medium governed by the Maxwell-Bloch equations. The validity of this model can break down, however, in systems such as dense, ordered atomic arrays, where strong interference in emission can give rise to phenomena such as subradiance and \&quot;selective\&quot; radiance. Here, we develop a general formalism that finds the maximum storage efficiency for a collection of atoms with discrete, known positions, and a given spatial mode in which an optical field is sent. As an example, we apply this technique to study a finite two-dimensional square array of atoms. We show that such a system enables a storage error that scales with atom number Na like \&sim;(logNa)2/N2a, and that, remarkably, an array of just 4\&times;4 atoms in principle allows for an efficiency comparable to a disordered ensemble with optical depth of around 600.</p>},

Here, we use state-of-the-art closed-coupling simulations to model quantum magnetism for pairs of ultracold spin-6 erbium lanthanide atoms placed in a deep optical lattice. In contrast to the widely used single-channel Hubbard model description of atoms and molecules in an optical lattice, we focus on the single-site multi-channel spin evolution due to spin-dependent contact, anisotropic van der Waals, and dipolar forces. This has allowed us to identify the leading mechanism, orbital anisotropy, that governs molecular spin dynamics among erbium atoms. The large magnetic moment and combined orbital angular momentum of the 4f-shell electrons are responsible for these strong anisotropic interactions and unconventional quantum magnetism. Multi-channel simulations of magnetic Cr atoms under similar trapping conditions show that their spin-evolution is controlled by spin-dependent contact interactions that are distinct in nature from the orbital anisotropy in Er. The role of an external magnetic field and the aspect ratio of the lattice site on spin dynamics is also investigated.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The circuit model of a quantum computer consists of sequences of gate operations between quantum bits (qubits), drawn from a universal family of discrete operations. The ability to execute parallel entangling quantum gates offers clear efficiency gains in numerous quantum circuits as well as for entire algorithms such as Shor\&$\#$39;s factoring algorithm and quantum simulations. In cases such as full adders and multiple-control Toffoli gates, parallelism can provide an exponential improvement in overall execution time. More importantly, quantum gate parallelism is essential for the practical fault-tolerant error correction of qubits that suffer from idle errors. The implementation of parallel quantum gates is complicated by potential crosstalk, especially between qubits fully connected by a common-mode bus, such as in Coulomb-coupled trapped atomic ions or cavity-coupled superconducting transmons. Here, we present the first experimental results for parallel 2-qubit entangling gates in an array of fully-connected trapped ion qubits. We demonstrate an application of this capability by performing a 1-bit full addition operation on a quantum computer using a depth-4 quantum circuit. These results exploit the power of highly connected qubit systems through classical control techniques, and provide an advance toward speeding up quantum circuits and achieving fault tolerance with trapped ion quantum computers.</p>},

To avoid this difficulty, the analysis is often restricted to measurement ensembles (or masks) that satisfy a small-ball probability condition, in order to ensure that the reconstruction is unique. This paper shows a complementary result: for random Bernoulli measurements, there is still a large class of signals that can be reconstructed uniquely, namely, those signals that are non-peaky. In fact, this result is much more general: it holds for random measurements sampled from any subgaussian distribution 2), without any small-ball conditions. This is demonstrated in two ways: 1) a proof of stability and uniqueness and 2) a uniform recovery guarantee for the PhaseLift algorithm. In all of these cases, the number of measurements m approaches the information-theoretic lower bound. Finally, for random Bernoulli measurements with erasures, it is shown that PhaseLift achieves uniform recovery of all signals (including peaky ones).</span></p>},

Rydberg blockade physics in optically dense atomic media leads to strong dissipative interactions between single photons. The regime of high incoming photon flux constitutes a challenging many-body dissipative problem. We experimentally study in detail for the first time the pulse shapes and the second-order correlation function of the outgoing field and compare our data with simulations based on two novel theoretical approaches well-suited to treat this many-photon limit. At low incoming flux, we report good agreement between both theories and the experiment. For higher input flux, the intensity of the outgoing light is lower than that obtained from theoretical predictions. We explain this discrepancy using a simple phenomenological model taking into account pollutants, which are nearly-stationary Rydberg excitations coming from the reabsorption of scattered probe photons. At high incoming photon rates, the blockade physics results in unconventional shapes of measured correlation functions.\&nbsp;</span></p>},

Here we focus on the effect of laser cooling on the photons instead of on the atoms. Specifically, we show that non-interacting photons can thermalize with the atoms to a grand canonical ensemble with a non-zero chemical potential. This thermalization is accomplished via scattering of light between different optical modes, mediated by the laser cooling process. While optically thin modes lead to traditional laser cooling of the atoms, the dynamics of multiple scattering in optically thick modes has been more challenging to describe. We find that in an appropriate set of limits, multiple scattering leads to thermalization of the light with the atomic motion in a manner that approximately conserves total photon number between the laser beams and optically thick modes. In this regime, the subsystem corresponding to the thermalized modes is describable by a grand canonical ensemble with a chemical potential set by the energy of a single laser photon. We consider realization of this regime using two-level atoms in Doppler cooling, and find physically realistic conditions for rare earth atoms. With the addition of photon-photon interactions, this system could provide a new platform for exploring many-body physics.</span></p>},

We compare our theory with existing experimental data from cavity-coupled InAs nanowire and GaAs 2DEG double quantum dots and find quantitative agreement only when the phonon sideband and photoemission processes during lead tunneling are taken into account.

Recently, we added to this list by showing how a machine learning algorithm (a so-called learner) combined with an optimization routine can assist experimental efforts in the realm of tuning semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices. Among other applications, semiconductor QDs are a candidate system for building quantum computers. The present-day tuning techniques for bringing the QD devices into a desirable configuration suitable for quantum computing that rely on heuristics do not scale with the increasing size of the quantum dot arrays required for even near-term quantum computing demonstrations. Establishing a reliable protocol for tuning that does not rely on the gross-scale heuristics developed by experimentalists is thus of great importance. To implement the machine learning-based approach, we constructed a dataset of simulated QD device characteristics, such as the conductance and the charge sensor response versus the applied electrostatic gate voltages. Here, we describe the methodology for generating the dataset, as well as its validation in training convolutional neural networks. We show that the learner\&$\#$39;s accuracy in recognizing the state of a device is ~96.5 \% in both current- and charge-sensor-based training. We also introduce a tool that enables other researchers to use this approach for further research: QFlow lite - a Python-based mini-software suite that uses the dataset to train neural networks to recognize the state of a device and differentiate between states in experimental data. This work gives the definitive reference for the new dataset that will help enable researchers to use it in their experiments or to develop new machine learning approaches and concepts</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum computation is a topic of significant recent interest, with practical advances coming from both research and industry. A major challenge in quantum programming is dealing with errors (quantum noise) during execution. Because quantum resources (e.g., qubits) are scarce, classical error correction techniques applied at the level of the architecture are currently cost-prohibitive. But while this reality means that quantum programs are almost certain to have errors, there as yet exists no principled means to reason about erroneous behavior. This paper attempts to fill this gap by developing a semantics for erroneous quantum while-programs, as well as a logic for reasoning about them. This logic permits proving a property we have identified, called ε-robustness, which characterizes possible \&quot;distance\&quot; between an ideal program and an erroneous one. We have proved the logic sound, and showed its utility on several case studies, notably: (1) analyzing the robustness of noisy versions of the quantum Bernoulli factory (QBF) and quantum walk (QW); (2) demonstrating the (in)effectiveness of different error correction schemes on single-qubit errors; and (3) analyzing the robustness of a fault-tolerant version of QBF.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quantum adiabatic optimization (QAO) is performed using a time-dependent Hamiltonian H(s) with spectral gap γ(s). Assuming the existence of an oracle Γ such that γ(s)=Θ(Γ(s)), we provide an algorithm that reliably performs QAO in time Oγ\&minus;1minlog(γ\&minus;1min) with Olog(γ\&minus;1min) oracle queries, where γmin=minsγ(s). Our strategy is not heuristic and does not require guessing time parameters or annealing paths. Rather, our algorithm naturally produces an annealing path such that dH/ds\&asymp;γ(s) and chooses its own runtime T to be as close as possible to optimal while promising convergence to the ground state. We then demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in practice by explicitly constructing a gap oracle Γ for the problem of finding a vertex m=argminuW(u) of the cost function W:V⟶[0,1], restricting ourselves to computational basis measurements and driving Hamiltonian H(0)=I\&minus;V\&minus;1\&sum;u,v\&isin;V|u\&rang;\&lang;v|, with V=|V|. Requiring only that W have a constant lower bound on its spectral gap and upper bound κ on its spectral ratio, our QAO algorithm returns m using Γ with probability (1\&minus;ε)(1\&minus;e\&minus;1/ε) in time O\&tilde;(ε\&minus;1[V\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;+(κ\&minus;1)2/3V2/3]).

Thus we find a much larger gap between classical and quantum algorithms than the univariate case, where the speedup is by a factor of 2.

Second, we introduce the channel\&$\#$39;s smooth max-information, which can be seen as a one-shot generalization of the mutual information of a quantum channel. We provide an exact operational interpretation of the channel\&$\#$39;s smooth max-information as the one-shot quantum simulation cost under no-signalling assisted codes. Third, we derive the asymptotic equipartition property of the channel\&$\#$39;s smooth max-information, i.e., it converges to the quantum mutual information of the channel in the independent and identically distributed asymptotic limit.

For such couplings and N=3, the clock model is expected to have a direct phase transition from a gapped phase with a broken global ZN symmetry, to a gapped phase with the ZN symmetry restored. The transition has dynamical critical exponent z\&ne;1, and so cannot be described by a relativistic quantum field theory. We use a lattice duality transformation to map the transition onto that of a Bose gas in d=1, involving the onset of a single boson condensate in the background of a higher-dimensional N-boson condensate.

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<p>We give two new quantum algorithms for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs) providing quantum speed-ups. We consider SDP instances with m constraint matrices, each of dimension n, rank r, and sparsity s. The first algorithm assumes an input model where one is given access to entries of the matrices at unit cost. We show that it has run time O~(s2(m\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;ε\&minus;10+n\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;ε\&minus;12)), where ε is the error. This gives an optimal dependence in terms of m,n and quadratic improvement over previous quantum algorithms when m\&asymp;n. The second algorithm assumes a fully quantum input model in which the matrices are given as quantum states. We show that its run time is O~(m\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;+poly(r))\&sdot;poly(logm,logn,B,ε\&minus;1), with B an upper bound on the trace-norm of all input matrices. In particular the complexity depends only poly-logarithmically in n and polynomially in r. We apply the second SDP solver to the problem of learning a good description of a quantum state with respect to a set of measurements: Given m measurements and copies of an unknown state ρ, we show we can find in time m\&minus;\&minus;\&radic;\&sdot;poly(logm,logn,r,ε\&minus;1) a description of the state as a quantum circuit preparing a density matrix which has the same expectation values as ρ on the m measurements, up to error ε. The density matrix obtained is an approximation to the maximum entropy state consistent with the measurement data considered in Jaynes\&$\#$39; principle from statistical mechanics. As in previous work, we obtain our algorithm by \&quot;quantizing\&quot; classical SDP solvers based on the matrix multiplicative weight method.

We develop a new \&quot;Singular value transformation\&quot; algorithm capable of harnessing this exponential advantage, that can apply polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary, generalizing the optimal Hamiltonian simulation results of Low and Chuang. The proposed quantum circuits have a very simple structure, often give rise to optimal algorithms and have appealing constant factors, while usually only use a constant number of ancilla qubits. We show that singular value transformation leads to novel algorithms. We give an efficient solution to a certain \&quot;non-commutative\&quot; measurement problem and propose a new method for singular value estimation. We also show how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum. Finally, as a quantum machine learning application we show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. \&quot;Singular value transformation\&quot; is conceptually simple and efficient, and leads to a unified framework of quantum algorithms incorporating a variety of quantum speed-ups. We illustrate this by showing how it generalizes a number of prominent quantum algorithms, including: optimal Hamiltonian simulation, implementing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse with exponential precision, fixed-point amplitude amplification, robust oblivious amplitude amplification, fast QMA amplification, fast quantum OR lemma, certain quantum walk results and several quantum machine learning algorithms. In order to exploit the strengths of the presented method it is useful to know its limitations too, therefore we also prove a lower bound on the efficiency of singular value transformation, which often gives optimal bounds.</span></p>},

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<p>A critical milestone on the path to useful quantum computers is quantum supremacy - a demonstration of a quantum computation that is prohibitively hard for classical computers. A leading near-term candidate, put forth by the Google/UCSB team, is sampling from the probability distributions of randomly chosen quantum circuits, which we call Random Circuit Sampling (RCS). In this paper we study both the hardness and verification of RCS. While RCS was defined with experimental realization in mind, we show complexity theoretic evidence of hardness that is on par with the strongest theoretical proposals for supremacy. Specifically, we show that RCS satisfies an average-case hardness condition - computing output probabilities of typical quantum circuits is as hard as computing them in the worst-case, and therefore $\#$P-hard. Our reduction exploits the polynomial structure in the output amplitudes of random quantum circuits, enabled by the Feynman path integral. In addition, it follows from known results that RCS satisfies an anti-concentration property, making it the first supremacy proposal with both average-case hardness and anti-concentration.\&nbsp;</p>},

A particular difficulty is how to fairly capture the notion of \&quot;predicting an unqueried value\&quot; when the adversary can query in quantum superposition. In this work, we uncover serious shortcomings in existing approaches, and propose a new definition. We then support its viability by a number of constructions and characterizations. Specifically, we demonstrate a function which is secure according to the existing definition by Boneh and Zhandry, but is clearly vulnerable to a quantum forgery attack, whereby a query supported only on inputs that start with 0 divulges the value of the function on an input that starts with 1. We then propose a new definition, which we call \&quot;blind-unforgeability\&quot; (or BU.) This notion matches \&quot;intuitive unpredictability\&quot; in all examples studied thus far. It defines a function to be predictable if there exists an adversary which can use \&quot;partially blinded\&quot; oracle access to predict values in the blinded region. Our definition (BU) coincides with standard unpredictability (EUF-CMA) in the classical-query setting. We show that quantum-secure pseudorandom functions are BU-secure MACs. In addition, we show that BU satisfies a composition property (Hash-and-MAC) using \&quot;Bernoulli-preserving\&quot; hash functions, a new notion which may be of independent interest. Finally, we show that BU is amenable to security reductions by giving a precise bound on the extent to which quantum algorithms can deviate from their usual behavior due to the blinding in the BU security experiment.\&nbsp;</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>Two topics, evolving rapidly in separate fields, were combined recently: The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) signals quantum-information scrambling in many-body systems. The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability represents operators in quantum optics. The OTOC has been shown to equal a moment of a summed quasiprobability. That quasiprobability, we argue, is an extension of the KD distribution. We explore the quasiprobability\&$\#$39;s structure from experimental, numerical, and theoretical perspectives. First, we simplify and analyze the weak-measurement and interference protocols for measuring the OTOC and its quasiprobability. We decrease, exponentially in system size, the number of trials required to infer the OTOC from weak measurements. We also construct a circuit for implementing the weak-measurement scheme. Next, we calculate the quasiprobability (after coarse-graining) numerically and analytically: We simulate a transverse-field Ising model first. Then, we calculate the quasiprobability averaged over random circuits, which model chaotic dynamics. The quasiprobability, we find, distinguishes chaotic from integrable regimes. We observe nonclassical behaviors: The quasiprobability typically has negative components. It becomes nonreal in some regimes. The onset of scrambling breaks a symmetry that bifurcates the quasiprobability, as in classical-chaos pitchforks. Finally, we present mathematical properties. The quasiprobability obeys a Bayes-type theorem, for example, that exponentially decreases the memory required to calculate weak values, in certain cases. A time-ordered correlator analogous to the OTOC, insensitive to quantum-information scrambling, depends on a quasiprobability closer to a classical probability. This work not only illuminates the OTOC\&$\#$39;s underpinnings, but also generalizes quasiprobability theory and motivates immediate-future weak-measurement challenges.</p>},

One method for characterising processes is randomised benchmarking, which is robust against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and can be used to benchmark Clifford gates. A complementing approach asks for full tomographic knowledge. Compressed sensing techniques achieve full tomography of quantum channels essentially at optimal resource efficiency. So far, guarantees for compressed sensing protocols rely on unstructured random measurements and can not be applied to the data acquired from randomised benchmarking experiments. It has been an open question whether or not the favourable features of both worlds can be combined. In this work, we give a positive answer to this question. For the important case of characterising multi-qubit unitary gates, we provide a rigorously guaranteed and practical reconstruction method that works with an essentially optimal number of average gate fidelities measured respect to random Clifford unitaries. Moreover, for general unital quantum channels we provide an explicit expansion into a unitary 2-design, allowing for a practical and guaranteed reconstruction also in that case. As a side result, we obtain a new statistical interpretation of the unitarity -- a figure of merit that characterises the coherence of a process. In our proofs we exploit recent representation theoretic insights on the Clifford group, develop a version of Collins\&$\#$39; calculus with Weingarten functions for integration over the Clifford group, and combine this with proof techniques from compressed sensing.</span></p>},

Using a Grassmann representation of fermionic Gaussian maps, we show that the Petz recovery map is also Gaussian and determine it explicitly in terms of the covariance matrix of the reference state and the data of the channel.

Any residual entanglement between the internal and motional states of the ions will result in decoherence errors, especially when there are many spectator ions in the crystal. We propose using a frequency-modulated (FM) driving force to minimize such errors and implement it experimentally. In simulation, we obtained an optimized FM gate that can suppress decoherence to less than 10\&minus;4 and is robust against a frequency drift of more than \&plusmn;1 kHz.

We also show an optimized FM two-qubit gate for 17 ions, proving the scalability of our method.</p>},

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<p>We study quantum information scrambling, specifically the growth of Heisenberg operators, in large disordered spin chains using matrix product operator dynamics to scan across the thermalization-localization quantum phase transition. We observe ballistic operator growth for weak disorder, and a sharp transition to a phase with sub-ballistic operator spreading. The critical disorder strength for the ballistic to sub-ballistic transition is well below the many body localization phase transition, as determined from finite size scaling of energy eigenstate entanglement entropy in small chains. In contrast, we find that the operator dynamics is not very sensitive to the actual eigenstate localization transition. These data are discussed in the context of a universal form for the growing operator shape and substantiated with a simple phenomenological model of rare regions.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>We study the phase-space representation of dynamics of bosons in the semiclassical regime where the occupation number of the modes is large. To this end, we employ the van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator to obtain an approximation for the Green\&$\#$39;s function of the Wigner distribution. The semiclassical analysis incorporates interference of classical paths and reduces to the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) when the interference is ignored. Furthermore, we identify the Ehrenfest time after which the TWA fails. As a case study, we consider a single-mode quantum nonlinear oscillator, which displays collapse and revival of observables. We analytically show that the interference of classical paths leads to revivals, an effect that is not reproduced by the TWA or a perturbative analysis.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>The SU(1,1) interferometer was originally conceived as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the beam-splitters replaced by parametric amplifiers. The parametric amplifiers produce states with correlations that result in enhanced phase sensitivity. F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can serve as the parametric amplifiers for an atomic version of such an interferometer by collisionally producing entangled pairs of \&lang;F=1,m=\&plusmn;1| atoms. We simulate the effect of single and double-sided seeding of the inputs to the amplifier using the truncated-Wigner approximation. We find that single-sided seeding degrades the performance of the interferometer exactly at the phase the unseeded interferometer should operate the best. Double-sided seeding results in a phase-sensitive amplifier, where the maximal sensitivity is a function of the phase relationship between the input states of the amplifier. In both single and double-sided seeding we find there exists an optimal phase shift that achieves sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. Experimentally, we demonstrate a spinor phase-sensitive amplifier using a BEC of 23Na in an optical dipole trap. This configuration could be used as an input to such an interferometer. We are able to control the initial phase of the double-seeded amplifier, and demonstrate sensitivity to initial population fractions as small as 0.1\%.\&nbsp;</p>},

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<p>We apply the periodized stationary phase method to discrete Wigner functions of systems with odd prime dimension using results from p-adic number theory. We derive the Wigner-Weyl-Moyal (WWM) formalism with higher order ℏ corrections representing contextual corrections to non-contextual Clifford operations. We apply this formalism to a subset of unitaries that include diagonal gates such as the π8 gates. We characterize the stationary phase critical points as a quantum resource injecting contextuality and show that this resource allows for the replacement of the p2t points that represent t magic state Wigner functions on p-dimensional qudits by \&le;pt points. We find that the π8 gate introduces the smallest higher order ℏ correction possible, requiring the lowest number of additional critical points compared to the Clifford gates. We then establish a relationship between the stabilizer rank of states and the number of critical points necessary to treat them in the WWM formalism. This allows us to exploit the stabilizer rank decomposition of two qutrit π8 gates to develop a classical strong simulation of a single qutrit marginal on t qutrit π8 gates that are followed by Clifford evolution, and show that this only requires calculating 3t2+1 critical points corresponding to Gauss sums. This outperforms the best alternative qutrit algorithm (based on Wigner negativity and scaling as \&sim;30.8t for 10\&minus;2 precision) for any number of π8 gates to full precision.</p>},

In both versions, the paths in a functional formulation are correlated via gravity itself, causing a breakdown of the superposition principle; however, the product form survives consistency tests not satisfied by the summed form. To better understand the structure of these two theories, we show how to perform diagrammatic expansions in the gravitational coupling for each version of CWL theory, using particle propagation and scalar fields as examples.

For such rare processes, background radiation must be carefully minimized. Radon provides one of the most significant contaminants since it is an inevitable product of trace amounts of natural uranium. To design a purification system for reducing such contamination, the adsorption characteristics of radon in nitrogen, argon, and xenon carrier gases on various types of charcoals with different adsorbing properties and intrinsic radioactive purities have been studied in the temperature range of 190-295 K at flow rates of 0.5 and 2 standard liters per minute.

Thus, understanding the function and structure of communities in learning environments is essential to education. We use social network analysis to explore the community dynamics of students in a pre-matriculation, two-week summer program. Unlike previous network analysis studies in PER, we build our networks from classroom video that has been coded for student interactions using labeled, directed ties. We define 3 types of interaction: on task interactions (regarding the assigned task), on topic interactions (having to do with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)), and off topic interactions (unrelated to the assignment or STEM). To study the development of community in this program, we analyze the shift in conversation topicality over the course of the program. Conversations are more on-task toward the end of the program and we propose that this conversational shift represents a change in student membership within their forming community.\&nbsp;</span></p>},

Our scheme relies on breaking time-reversal symmetry by a spatially varying laser drive, which manipulates low-energy acoustic phonons. Furthermore, we take advantage of recent developments in the manipulation of high-energy phonons through controlled scattering mechanisms, such as using alloys and introducing disorder. These combined approaches allow us to design an acoustic isolator and a thermal diode.

This time-reversal property states that the maximum value obtained by such a function over all valid quantum strategies is also obtained when the direction of time for the function is reversed, despite the fact that the strategies themselves are generally not time reversible.

To this end, we aim to identify a practical problem that is beyond the reach of current classical computers, but that requires the fewest resources for a quantum computer. We consider quantum simulation of spin systems, which could be applied to understand condensed matter phenomena. We synthesize explicit circuits for three leading quantum simulation algorithms, using diverse techniques to tighten error bounds and optimize circuit implementations. Quantum signal processing appears to be preferred among algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees, whereas higher-order product formulas prevail if empirical error estimates suffice. Our circuits are orders of magnitude smaller than those for the simplest classically infeasible instances of factoring and quantum chemistry, bringing practical quantum computation closer to reality.</span></p>},

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<div>We report a holographic study of a two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory with the Dirichlet boundary condition for the cases of non-vanishing and vanishing cosmological constants. Our result shows that the boundary theory of the two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory with the Dirichlet boundary condition for the case of non-vanishing cosmological constants is the Schwarzian term coupled to a dilaton field, while for the case of vanishing cosmological constant, a theory does not have a kinetic term. We also include the higher derivative term R2, where R is the scalar curvature that is coupled to a dilaton field. We find that the form of the boundary theory is not modified perturbatively. Finally, we show that a lattice holographic picture is realized up to the second-order perturbation of boundary cut-off ε2 under a constant boundary dilaton field and the non-vanishing cosmological constant by identifying the lattice spacing a of a lattice Schwarzian theory with the boundary cut-off ε of the two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory.\&nbsp;</div>},

Classically, security games use string copying and comparison to detect adversarial cheating in such scenarios. Quantumly, this approach would violate no-cloning.

We give definitions for (i) ciphertext unforgeability, (ii) indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack, and (iii) authenticated encryption. The restriction of each definition to the classical setting is at least as strong as the corresponding classical notion: (i) implies\&nbsp;\&nbsp; INT-CTXT , (ii) implies\&nbsp;\&nbsp; IND-CCA2 , and (iii) implies\&nbsp;\&nbsp; AE .

In this work, we examine the impact of different graph structures on the preparation of entangled states. We begin by explaining a formal framework, the hierarchical product, in which modular graphs can be easily constructed. This framework naturally leads us to suggest a class of graphs, which we dub hierarchies. We argue that such graphs have favorable properties for quantum information processing, such as a small diameter and small total edge weight, and use the concept of Pareto efficiency to identify promising quantum graph architectures. We present numerical and analytical results on the speed at which large entangled states can be created on nearest-neighbor grids and hierarchy graphs. We also present a scheme for performing circuit placement--the translation from circuit diagrams to machine qubits--on quantum systems whose connectivity is described by hierarchies.</p>},

	title = {Verified Quantum Information Scrambling},
	year = {2018},
	abstract = {<p>Quantum scrambling is the dispersal of local information into many-body quantum entanglements and correlations distributed throughout the entire system. This concept underlies the dynamics of thermalization in closed quantum systems, and more recently has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing chaos in black holes. However, the direct experimental measurement of quantum scrambling is difficult, owing to the exponential complexity of ergodic many-body entangled states. One way to characterize quantum scrambling is to measure an out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC); however, since scrambling leads to their decay, OTOCs do not generally discriminate between quantum scrambling and ordinary decoherence. Here, we implement a quantum circuit that provides a positive test for the scrambling features of a given unitary process. This approach conditionally teleports a quantum state through the circuit, providing an unambiguous litmus test for scrambling while projecting potential circuit errors into an ancillary observable. We engineer quantum scrambling processes through a tunable 3-qubit unitary operation as part of a 7-qubit circuit on an ion trap quantum computer. Measured teleportation fidelities are typically \&sim;80\%, and enable us to experimentally bound the scrambling-induced decay of the corresponding OTOC measurement.</p>},

Here, we explore above threshold collisions at well-defined energies in the vicinity of a narrow magnetic Feshbach resonance by means of a laser-based collider. Our experiment focuses on collisions between ground-state 87Rb atoms in the |F = 2,mF = 0i and |F = 1,mF = 1i hyperfine states, which have a known s-wave resonance at 9.040(7) G at threshold that strongly couples to inelastic channels, where 1 G = 10\&minus;4 T. Using our collider we can track the magnetic field shift in resonance position as the energy is tuned. This presents a challenge due to the narrow width of the resonance in conjunction with inherent broadening mechanisms of the collider. We find, however, that the narrow Feshbach scattering feature becomes imprinted on the spatial distribution of atoms in a fashion that allows for an accurate determination of resonance position as a function of collision energy through a shift in center-of-mass position of the outgoing clouds. This shift has a dispersive line shape with a zero value at the resonance position. We obtain excellent agreement with theory on the resonance position.</p>},

Reinforcement learning, an interactive form of learning, is, in turn, vital in artificial intelligence-type applications. Also in this case, quantum mechanics was shown to be useful, in certain instances. Here, we elucidate these results, and show that quantum enhancements can be achieved in a new setting: the setting of learning models which learn how to improve themselves -- that is, those that meta-learn. While not all learning models meta-learn, all non-trivial models have the potential of being \&quot;lifted\&quot;, enhanced, to meta-learning models. Our results show that also such models can be quantum-enhanced to make even better learners. In parallel, we address one of the bottlenecks of current quantum reinforcement learning approaches: the need for so-called oracularized variants of task environments. Here we elaborate on a method which realizes these variants, with minimal changes in the setting, and with no corruption of the operative specification of the environments. This result may be important in near-term experimental demonstrations of quantum reinforcement learning.</span></p>},

The Grover search algorithm provides a powerful method for quantum computers to perform searches with a quadratic speedup in the number of required database queries over classical computers. It is an optimal search algorithm for a quantum computer, and has further applications as a subroutine for other quantum algorithms. Searches with two qubits have been demonstrated on a variety of platforms and proposed for others, but larger search spaces have only been demonstrated on a non-scalable NMR system. Here, we report results for a complete three-qubit Grover search algorithm using the scalable quantum computing technology of trapped atomic ions, with better-than-classical performance. The algorithm is performed for all 8 possible single-result oracles and all 28 possible two-result oracles. Two methods of state marking are used for the oracles: a phase-flip method employed by other experimental demonstrations, and a Boolean method requiring an ancilla qubit that is directly equivalent to the state-marking scheme required to perform a classical search. All quantum solutions are shown to outperform their classical counterparts. We also report the first implementation of a Toffoli-4 gate, which is used along with Toffoli-3 gates to construct the algorithms; these gates have process fidelities of 70.5\% and 89.6\%, respectively.</span></p>},

We investigate to what extent the classical notions of computational entropy generalize to the quantum setting, and whether quantum analogues of classical theorems hold. Our main results are as follows. (1) The classical Leakage Chain Rule for pseudoentropy can be extended to the case that the leakage information is quantum (while the source remains classical). Specifically, if the source has pseudoentropy at least k, then it has pseudoentropy at least k \&minus; l conditioned on an l- qubit leakage. (2) As an application of the Leakage Chain Rule, we construct the first quantum leakage-resilient stream-cipher in the bounded-quantum-storage model, assuming the existence of a quantum-secure pseudorandom generator. (3) We show that the general form of the classical Dense Model Theorem (interpreted as the equivalence between two definitions of pseudo-relativemin-entropy) does not extend to quantum states. Along the way, we develop quantum analogues of some classical techniques (e.g., the Leakage Simulation Lemma, which is proven by a Nonuniform Min-Max Theorem or Boosting). On the other hand, we also identify some classical techniques (e.g., Gap Amplification) that do not work in the quantum setting.

For example, similar to neutral atoms and trapped ions, laser cooling of mechanical motion by radiation pressure can take single mechanical modes to their ground state. Conventional optomechanical cooling is able to introduce additional damping channel to mechanical motion, while keeping its thermal noise at the same level, and as a consequence, the effective temperature of the mechanical mode is lowered. However, the ratio of temperature to quality factor remains roughly constant, preventing dramatic advances in quantum sensing using this approach. Here we propose an approach for simultaneously reducing the thermal load on a mechanical resonator while improving its quality factor. In essence, we use the optical interaction to dynamically modify the dominant damping mechanism, providing an optomechanically-induced effect analogous to a phononic band gap. The mechanical mode of interest is assumed to be weakly coupled to its heat bath but strongly coupled to a second mechanical mode, which is cooled by radiation pressure coupling to a red detuned cavity field. We also identify a realistic optomechanical design that has the potential to realize this novel cooling scheme.</span></p>},

In our approach, we separate the single-polariton EIT physics from Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in a serialized manner while using a hard-sphere model for the latter, thus capturing the dualistic particle-wave nature of light as it manifests itself in dissipative Rydberg-EIT media. Using this approach, we analyze the saturation behavior of the transmission through one-dimensional Rydberg-EIT media in the regime of non-perturbative dissipative interactions relevant to current experiments. Our model is in good agreement with experimental data. We also analyze a scheme for generating regular trains of single photons from continuous-wave input and derive its scaling behavior in the presence of imperfect single-photon EIT.</span></p>},

The pressure is determined from a thermally-averaged collision cross section, which is a fundamental atomic property, and the measured loss rate. The CAVS is primary because it will use collision cross sections determined from ab initio calculations for the Li + H2 system.

For strong enough disorder, this gap closes and all the states become localized as the system undergoes a transition to a trivial insulator. Interestingly, the effects of disorder are not necessarily adverse: we show that in the same quantum well, disorder can also induce a transition from a trivial to a topological system, thereby establishing a Floquet Topological Anderson Insulator (FTAI).

In electronic and optical settings, introduction of chiral transport - in which carrier propagation exhibits broken parity symmetry - provides robustness against such disorder by preventing elastic backscattering. Here we experimentally demonstrate a path for achieving robust phonon transport even in the presence of material disorder, by dynamically inducing chirality through traveling-wave optomechanical coupling. Using this approach, we demonstrate dramatic optically-induced chiral transport for clockwise and counterclockwise phonons in a symmetric resonator. This induced chirality also enhances isolation from the thermal bath and leads to gain-free reduction of the intrinsic damping of the phonons. Surprisingly, this passive mechanism is also accompanied by a chiral reduction in heat load leading to a novel optical cooling of the mechanics. This technique has the potential to improve upon the fundamental thermal limits of resonant mechanical sensor, which cannot be otherwise attained through conventional optomechanical cooling.</span></p>},

The first class is based on solving linear systems, and the second class is based on using quantum walks. These algorithms compute various electrical quantities, including voltages, currents, dissipated powers and effective resistances, in time poly(d, c,log(N),1/λ,1/ε), where N is the number of vertices in the network, d is the maximum unweighted degree of the vertices, c is the ratio of largest to smallest edge resistance, λ is the spectral gap of the normalized Laplacian of the network, and ε is the accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the polynomial dependence on 1/λ is necessary. This implies that our algorithms are optimal up to polynomial factors and cannot be signficantly improved.</p>},

We give the first efficient quantum algorithms for simulating Markovian quantum dynamics generated by Lindbladians that are not necessarily local. We introduce two approaches to simulating sparse Lindbladians. First, we show how to simulate Lindbladians that act within small invariant subspaces using a quantum algorithm to implement sparse Stinespring isometries. Second, we develop a method for simulating sparse Lindblad operators by concatenating a sequence of short-time evolutions. We also show limitations on Lindbladian simulation by proving a no-fast-forwarding theorem for simulating sparse Lindbladians in a black-box model.</span></p>},

We consider the behavior of three photons injected into the gas in their propagating frame, where a paraxial approximation allows us to consider them as massive particles. In contrast to atoms and nuclei, the photons have a large anisotropy between their longitudinal mass, arising from dispersion, and their transverse mass, arising from diffraction. Nevertheless, we show that in suitably rescaled coordinates the effective interactions become dominated by s-wave scattering near threshold and, as a result, give rise to an Efimov effect near unitarity, but with spatially anisotropic wavefunctions in the original coordinates. We show that the three-body loss of these Efimov trimers can be strongly suppressed and determine conditions under which these states are observable in current experiments. These effects can be naturally extended to probe few-body universality beyond three bodies, as well as the role of Efimov physics in the non-equilbrium, many-body regime.</span></p>},

At this interface, the standard techniques and intuitions of both fields are called into question, obscuring issues as fundamental as the role of fluctuations, dimensionality, and symmetry on the nature of collective behavior and phase transitions. Here, we study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, a minimal description of numerous atomic, optical, and solid-state systems in which particle loss is countered by coherent driving. Despite being a lattice version of optical bistability---a foundational and patently non-equilibrium model of cavity-QED---the steady state possesses an emergent equilibrium description in terms of a classical Ising model. We establish this picture by identifying a limit in which the quantum dynamics is asymptotically equivalent to non-equilibrium Langevin equations, which support a phase transition described by model A of the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Numerical simulations of the Langevin equations corroborate this picture, producing results consistent with the behavior of a finite-temperature Ising model.</span></p>},

It has recently been proposed that any low-energy local bulk operators in a CFT boundary region\&$\#$39;s entanglement wedge can be reconstructed on that boundary region itself. Existing work arguing for this proposal relies on algebraic consequences of the exact equivalence between bulk and boundary relative entropies, namely the theory of operator algebra quantum error correction. However, bulk and boundary relative entropies are only approximately equal in bulk effective field theory, and in similar situations it is known that predictions from exact entropic equalities can be qualitatively incorrect. The framework of universal recovery channels provides a robust demonstration of the entanglement wedge reconstruction conjecture in addition to new physical insights. Most notably, we find that a bulk operator acting in a given boundary region\&$\#$39;s entanglement wedge can be expressed as the response of the boundary region\&$\#$39;s modular Hamiltonian to a perturbation of the bulk state in the direction of the bulk operator. This formula can be interpreted as a noncommutative version of Bayes\&$\#$39; rule that attempts to undo the noise induced by restricting to only a portion of the boundary, and has an integral representation in terms of modular flows. To reach these conclusions, we extend the theory of universal recovery channels to finite-dimensional operator algebras and demonstrate that recovery channels approximately preserve the multiplicative structure of the operator algebra</span></p>},

In particular, we construct a specific example of an Ising Hamiltonian that, after time evolution starting from a trivial initial state, produces a particular output configuration with probability very nearly proportional to the square of the permanent of a matrix with arbitrary integer entries. In a similar spirit to boson sampling, the ability to sample classically from the probability distribution induced by time evolution under this Hamiltonian would imply unlikely complexity theoretic consequences, suggesting that the dynamics of such a spin model cannot be efficiently simulated with a classical computer.

One is a publicly accessible superconducting transmon device [1] with limited connectivity, and the other is a fully connected trapped-ion system [2]. Even though the two systems have different native quantum interactions, both can be programmed in a way that is blind to the underlying hardware, thus allowing the first comparison of identical quantum algorithms between different physical systems. We show that quantum algorithms and circuits that employ more connectivity clearly benefit from a better connected system of qubits. While the quantum systems here are not yet large enough to eclipse classical computers, this experiment exposes critical factors of scaling quantum computers, such as qubit connectivity and gate expressivity. In addition, the results suggest that co-designing particular quantum applications with the hardware itself will be paramount in successfully using quantum computers in the future.</p>},

However, it is difficult to certify whether a physical random number generator is truly unpredictable. Here, we exploit the phenomenon of quantum nonlocality in a loophole-free photonic Bell test experiment for the generation of randomness that cannot be predicted within any physical theory that allows one to make independent measurement choices and prohibits superluminal signaling. To certify and quantify the randomness, we describe a new protocol that performs well in an experimental regime characterized by low violation of Bell inequalities. Applying an extractor function to our data, we obtained 256 new random bits, uniform to within 0.001.</span></p>},

	year = {2017},
	abstract = {<p>Quantum computers can offer dramatic improvements over classical devices for data analysis tasks such as prediction and classification. However, less is known about the advantages that quantum computers may bring in the setting of reinforcement learning, where learning is achieved via interaction with a task environment. Here, we consider a special case of reinforcement learning, where the task environment allows quantum access. In addition, we impose certain \&quot;naturalness\&quot; conditions on the task environment, which rule out the kinds of oracle problems that are studied in quantum query complexity (and for which quantum speedups are well-known). Within this framework of quantum-accessible reinforcement learning environments, we demonstrate that quantum agents can achieve exponential improvements in learning efficiency, surpassing previous results that showed only quadratic improvements. A key step in the proof is to construct task environments that encode well-known oracle problems, such as Simon\&$\#$39;s problem and Recursive Fourier Sampling, while satisfying the above \&quot;naturalness\&quot; conditions for reinforcement learning. Our results suggest that quantum agents may perform well in certain game-playing scenarios, where the game has recursive structure, and the agent can learn by playing against itself</p>},

	abstract = {<p>We give semidefinite program (SDP) quantum solvers with an exponential speed-up over classical ones. Specifically, we consider SDP instances with m constraint matrices of dimension n, each of rank at most r, and assume that the input matrices of the SDP are given as quantum states (after a suitable normalization). Then we show there is a quantum algorithm that solves the SDP feasibility problem with accuracy ǫ by using \&radic; m log m \&middot; poly(log n,r, ǫ \&minus;1 ) quantum gates. The dependence on n provides an exponential improvement over the work of Brand \&tilde;ao and Svore [6] and the work of van Apeldoorn et al. [23], and demonstrates an exponential quantum speed-up when m and r are small. We apply the SDP solver to the problem of learning a good description of a quantum state with respect to a set of measurements: Given m measurements and a supply of copies of an unknown state ρ, we show we can find in time \&radic; m log m \&middot; poly(log n,r, ǫ \&minus;1 ) a description of the state as a quantum circuit preparing a density matrix which has the same expectation values as ρ on the m measurements up to error ǫ. The density matrix obtained is an approximation to the maximum entropy state consistent with the measurement data considered in Jaynes\&rsquo; principle. As in previous work, we obtain our algorithm by \&ldquo;quantizing\&rdquo; classical SDP solvers based on the matrix multiplicative weight update method. One of our main technical contributions is a quantum Gibbs state sampler for low-rank Hamiltonians with a poly-logarithmic dependence on its dimension based on the techniques developed in quantum principal component analysis, which could be of independent interest. Our quantum SDP solver is different from previous ones in the following two aspects: (1) it follows from a zero-sum game approach of Hazan [11] of solving SDPs rather than the primal-dual approach by Arora and Kale [5]; and (2) it does not rely on any sparsity assumption of the input matrices.</p>},

In some cases, this geometry is found to reproduce key properties of holographic dualities, and subsequently much work has focused on using tensor networks as tractable models for holographic dualities. Conventionally, the structure of the network - and hence the geometry - is largely fixed a priori by the choice of tensor network ansatz. Here, we evade this restriction and describe an unbiased approach that allows us to extract the appropriate geometry from a given quantum state. We develop an algorithm that iteratively finds a unitary circuit that transforms a given quantum state into an unentangled product state. We then analyze the structure of the resulting unitary circuits. In the case of non-interacting, critical systems in one dimension, we recover signatures of scale invariance in the unitary network, and we show that appropriately defined geodesic paths between physical degrees of freedom exhibit known properties of a hyperbolic geometry.</span></p>},

We further extend their method to the case of multiple input states, showing how to simulate any Hermitian polynomial of the states provided. As applications, we derive optimal algorithms for commutator simulation and orthogonality testing, and we give a protocol for creating a coherent superposition of pure states, when given sample access to those states.

When the coherence length exceeds the wavelength of light, one can expect new phenomena to occur in the optical response of these states. We theoretically characterize this limit for integer quantum Hall states in two-dimensional Dirac materials. We find that the radiation from the bulk is dominated by dipole emission, whose spectral properties vary with the local disorder potential. On the other hand, the radiation from the edge is characterized by large multipole moments in the far-field associated with the efficient transfer of angular momentum from the electrons into the scattered light. These results demonstrate that high-order multipole transitions are a necessary component for the optical spectroscopy and control of quantum Hall and related topological states in electronic systems.</span></p>},

However, qubits based on electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots have proven challenging to couple to microwave photons. In this theoretical work we show that a sizable coupling for a single electron spin is possible via spin-charge hybridization using a magnetic field gradient in a silicon double quantum dot. Based on parameters already shown in recent experiments, we predict optimal working points to achieve a coherent spin-photon coupling, an essential ingredient for the generation of long-range entanglement. Furthermore, we employ input-output theory to identify observable signatures of spin-photon coupling in the cavity output field, which may provide guidance to the experimental search for strong coupling in such spin-photon systems and opens the way to cavity-based readout of the spin qubit.</span></p>},

A laser is tuned into resonance between two Landau levels, giving rise to an effective tunneling between these two synthetic layers. Remarkably, because of this coupling, the interlayer interaction at non-zero relative angular momentum can become dominant, resembling a hollow-core pseudo-potential. In the weak tunneling regime, this interaction favors the formation of singlet states, as we explicitly show by numerical diagonalization, at fillings ν = 1/2 and ν = 2/3. We discuss possible candidate phases, including the Haldane-Rezayi phase, the interlayer Pfaffian phase, and a Fibonacci phase. This demonstrates that our method may pave the way towards the realization of non-Abelian phases, as well as the control of topological phase transitions, in graphene quantum Hall systems using optical fields and integrated photonic structures.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Recent progress in building large-scale quantum devices for exploring quantum computing and simulation paradigms has relied upon effective tools for achieving and maintaining good experimental parameters, i.e. tuning up devices. In many cases, including in quantum-dot based architectures, the parameter space grows substantially with the number of qubits, and may become a limit to scalability. Fortunately, machine learning techniques for pattern recognition and image classification using so-called deep neural networks have shown surprising successes for computer-aided understanding of complex systems. In this work, we use deep and convolutional neural networks to characterize states and charge configurations of semiconductor quantum dot arrays when one can only measure a current-voltage characteristic of transport (here conductance) through such a device. For simplicity, we model a semiconductor nanowire connected to leads and capacitively coupled to depletion gates using the Thomas-Fermi approximation and Coulomb blockade physics. We then generate labeled training data for the neural networks, and find at least 90 \% accuracy for charge and state identification for single and double dots purely from the dependence of the nanowire\&rsquo;s conductance upon gate voltages. Using these characterization networks, we can then optimize the parameter space to achieve a desired configuration of the array, a technique we call \&lsquo;auto-tuning\&rsquo;. Finally, we show how such techniques can be implemented in an experimental setting by applying our approach to an experimental data set, and outline further problems in this domain, from using charge sensing data to extensions to full one and two-dimensional arrays, that can be tackled with machine learning.</p>},

In particular, we introduce a new technique which bounds the spectral gap of such Laplacians (Hamiltonians) by studying the limiting behavior of the oscillations of their eigenvectors when introduced into the heat equation. Our approach is based on recent advances in the PDE literature, which include a proof of the fundamental gap theorem by Andrews and Clutterbuck.</p>},

We find that the steady state phase diagram is substantially modified compared to its equilibrium counterpart, including the appearance of a multicritical point belonging to a different universality class. Building on our variational analysis, we establish a field-theoretical treatment corresponding to a dissipative variant of a Ginzburg-Landau theory, which allows us to compute the upper critical dimension of the system. Finally, we present a possible experimental realization of the dissipative Ising model using ultracold Rydberg gases.</p>},

In this work we examine analogues of Bell\&$\#$39;s inequalities for synchronous correlations. We show that, unlike general correlations and the CHSH inequality, there can be no quantum Bell violation among synchronous correlations with two measurement settings. However we exhibit explicit analogues of Bell\&$\#$39;s inequalities for synchronous correlations with three measurement settings and two outputs, provide an analogue of Tsirl\&$\#$39;son\&$\#$39;s bound in this setting, and give explicit quantum correlations that saturate this bound.</span></p>},

As more control is exerted over larger numbers of qubits, the simulator can tackle a wider range of problems, with the ultimate limit being a universal quantum computer that can solve general classes of hard problems. We use a quantum simulator composed of up to 53 qubits to study a non-equilibrium phase transition in the transverse field Ising model of magnetism, in a regime where conventional statistical mechanics does not apply. The qubits are represented by trapped ion spins that can be prepared in a variety of initial pure states. We apply a global long-range Ising interaction with controllable strength and range, and measure each individual qubit with near 99\% efficiency. This allows the single-shot measurement of arbitrary many-body correlations for the direct probing of the dynamical phase transition and the uncovering of computationally intractable features that rely on the long-range interactions and high connectivity between the qubits.</span></p>},

A balance has to be struck between these two aspects. Perfect quantum gates do not exist in nature. Therefore, it is important to investigate how flaws in the quantum hardware affect quantum computing performance. We do this in two steps. First, in the presence of realistic, faulty quantum hardware, we establish how quantum error correction circuitry achieves reduction in the extent of quantum information corruption. Then, we investigate fault-tolerant gate sequence techniques that result in an approximate phase rotation gate, and establish the existence of an optimal length\&nbsp;</span><span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 17px; letter-spacing: 0.102px; background-color: rgb(252, 252, 252);"><span class="MathJax" data-mathml="\&lt;math xmlns=\&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\&quot;\&gt;\&lt;msub\&gt;\&lt;mi\&gt;L\&lt;/mi\&gt;\&lt;mrow class=\&quot;MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\&quot;\&gt;\&lt;mtext\&gt;opt\&lt;/mtext\&gt;\&lt;/mrow\&gt;\&lt;/msub\&gt;\&lt;/math\&gt;" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" role="presentation" style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline; line-height: normal; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: normal; word-wrap: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; position: relative;" tabindex="0"><nobr aria-hidden="true" style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; border: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal;"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; display: inline-block; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; width: 2.016em;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; display: inline-block; position: relative; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; width: 1.804em; height: 0px; font-size: 18.87px;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; position: absolute; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; clip: rect(1.275em 1001.8em 2.546em -999.997em); top: -2.117em; left: 0em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2" style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal;"><span class="msubsup" id="MathJax-Span-3" style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; display: inline-block; position: relative; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; width: 1.804em; height: 0px;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; position: absolute; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; clip: rect(3.129em 1000.64em 4.136em -999.997em); top: -3.972em; left: 0em;"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-4" style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">L</span></span><span style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; position: absolute; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; top: -3.813em; left: 0.692em;"><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-5" style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-6" style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal;"><span class="mtext" id="MathJax-Span-7" style="box-sizing: border-box; transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; font-size: 13.3411px; font-family: MathJax_Main;">opt</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation" style="box-sizing: border-box; top: 0px; left: 0px; clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); user-select: none; position: static; display: inline; transition: none; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; height: 1px !important; width: 1px !important; overflow: hidden !important;"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>L</mi><mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mtext>opt</mtext></mrow></msub></math></span></span></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 17px; letter-spacing: 0.102px; background-color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">\&nbsp;of the length\&nbsp;</span><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic " style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 17px; letter-spacing: 0.102px; background-color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">L</em><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 17px; letter-spacing: 0.102px; background-color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">\&nbsp;of the decomposition sequence.

Here we consider how quantized electromagnetic fields become entangled with the scale factor in a toy version of the FRW model. A system consisting of a photon, source, and detector is described in such a universe, and we find that the detection of a redshifted photon by the detector system constrains possible scale factor superpositions. Thus, measuring the redshift of the photon is equivalent to a weak measurement of the underlying cosmology. We also consider a potential optomechanical analogy system that would enable experimental exploration of these concepts. The analogy focuses on the effects of photon redshift measurement as a quantum back-action on metric variables, where the position of a movable mirror plays the role of the scale factor. By working in the rotating frame, an effective Hubble equation can be simulated with a simple free moving mirror.</p>},

Optomechanical systems have emerged as a potential platform for optical non-reciprocity, due to ability of a pump laser to break time and parity symmetry in the system. Here we consider how the non-reciprocal behavior of light can also impact the transport of sound in optomechanical devices. We focus on the case of a quasi one dimensional optical ring resonator with many mechanical modes coupled to light via the acousto-optic effect. The addition of disorder leads to finite diffusion for phonon transport in the material, largely due to elastic backscattering between clockwise and counter-clockwise phonons. We show that a laser pump field, along with the assumption of high quality-factor, sideband-resolved optical resonances, suppresses the effects of disorder and leads to the emergence of chiral diffusion, with direction-dependent diffusion emerging in a bandwidth similar to the phase-matching bandwidth for Brillouin scattering. A simple diagrammatic theory connects the observation of reduced mechanical linewidths directly to the associated phonon diffusion properties, and helps explain recent experimental results.</span></p>},

Focussing on the case of a two-level system, we calculate microscopically the decay times τi and the value of the saturation constant. Because some OTOCs are immune to dephasing processes and some are not, such correlators may decay on two sets of parametrically different time scales related to inelastic transitions between the system levels and to pure dephasing processes, respectively. In the case of a classical environment, the evolution of the OTOC can be mapped onto the evolution of the density matrix of two systems coupled to the same dissipative environment.</p>},

These properties and others suggest that this model realizes a new, nonthermal phase of matter, known as a quantum disentangled liquid (QDL). The putative existence of this phase has striking implications for the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics.</span></p>},

For such \&quot;penalty models,\&quot; one desires the additional property that the gap in the objective value between such minima and states that fail the constraints is maximized amongst the allowable objective functions. In this short note, we prove the standard penalty model for the constraint that a bitstring has given Hamming weight is optimal with respect to objective value gap.</span></p>},

This problem has applications to quantum process tomography, when the unknown process is a unitary operation. We show that PhaseLift, a convex programming algorithm for phase retrieval, can be adapted to this matrix setting, using measurements that are sampled from unitary 4- and 2-designs. In the case of unitary 4-design measurements, we show that PhaseLift can reconstruct all unitary matrices, using a nearoptimal number of measurements. This extends previous work on PhaseLift using spherical 4-designs. In the case of unitary 2-design measurements, we show that PhaseLift still works pretty well on average: it recovers almost all signals, up to a constant additive error, using a near-optimal number of measurements. These 2-design measurements are convenient for quantum process tomography, as they can be implemented via randomized benchmarking techniques. This is the first positive result on PhaseLift using 2-designs.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>Quenches in isolated quantum systems are currently a subject of intense study. Here, we consider quantum few-mode systems that are integrable in their classical mean-field limit and become dynamically unstable after a quench of a system parameter. Specifically, we study a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a double-well potential and an antiferromagnetic spinor BEC constrained to a single spatial mode. We study the time dynamics after the quench within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) and find that system relaxes to a steady state due to phase-space mixing. Using the action-angle formalism and a pendulum as an illustration, we derive general analytical expressions for the time evolution of expectation values of observables and their long-time limits. We find that the deviation of the long-time expectation value from its classical value scales as 1/O(ln N), where N is the number of atoms in the condensate. Furthermore, the relaxation of an observable to its steady state value is a damped oscillation and the damping is Gaussian in time. We confirm our results with numerical TWA simulations.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>With nowadays steadily growing quantum processors, it is required to develop new quantum tomography tools that are tailored for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we describe such a computational tool, based on recent ideas from non-convex optimization. The algorithm excels in the compressed-sensing-like setting, where only a few data points are measured from a lowrank or highly-pure quantum state of a high-dimensional system. We show that the algorithm can practically be used in quantum tomography problems that are beyond the reach of convex solvers, and, moreover, is faster than other state-of-the-art non-convex approaches. Crucially, we prove that, despite being a non-convex program, under mild conditions, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum of the problem; thus, it constitutes a provable quantum state tomography protocol.</p>},

The algorithm produces a quantum state that is proportional to the solution at a desired final time. The complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the logarithm of the inverse error, an exponential improvement over previous quantum algorithms for this problem. Our result builds upon recent advances in quantum linear systems algorithms by encoding the simulation into a sparse, well-conditioned linear system that approximates evolution according to the propagator using a Taylor series. Unlike with finite difference methods, our approach does not require additional hypotheses to ensure numerical stability.</span></p>},

Different from previous algorithms which only yield a quantum state encoding the optimal parameters, our algorithm outputs these numbers in the classical form. So by running it once, one completely determines the fitted model and then can use it to make predictions on new data at negligible cost. Moreover, our algorithm does not require the design matrix to be sparse or need any help from additional state preparation procedures. It runs in time poly(log(N), d, κ, 1/), where N is the size of the data set, d is the number of adjustable parameters, κ is the condition number of the design matrix, and  is the desired precision in the output. We also show that the polynomial dependence on d and κ is necessary. Thus, our algorithm cannot be significantly improved. Furthermore, we also give a quantum algorithm that estimates the quality of the least-squares fit without computing its parameters explicitly. This algorithm runs faster than the one for finding this fit, and can be used to check whether the given data set qualifies for linear regression in the first place.</p>},

Recent research has shown that such schemes exist even for quantum computation. Given the numerous applications of classical FHE (zero-knowledge proofs, secure two-party computation, obfuscation, etc.) it is reasonable to hope that quantum FHE (or QFHE) will lead to many new results in the quantum setting. However, a crucial ingredient in almost all applications of FHE is circuit verification. Classically, verification is performed by checking a transcript of the homomorphic computation. Quantumly, this strategy is impossible due to no-cloning. This leads to an important open question: can quantum computations be delegated and verified in a non-interactive manner? In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative, by constructing a scheme for QFHE with verification (vQFHE). Our scheme provides authenticated encryption, and enables arbitrary polynomial-time quantum computations without the need of interaction between client and server. Verification is almost entirely classical; for computations that start and end with classical states, it is completely classical. As a first application, we show how to construct quantum one-time programs from classical one-time programs and vQFHE.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>In encryption, non-malleability is a highly desirable property: it ensures that adversaries cannot manipulate the plaintext by acting on the ciphertext. In [6], Ambainis et al. gave a definition of non-malleability for the encryption of quantum data. In this work, we show that this definition is too weak, as it allows adversaries to \&ldquo;inject\&rdquo; plaintexts of their choice into the ciphertext. We give a new definition of quantum non-malleability which resolves this problem. Our definition is expressed in terms of entropic quantities, considers stronger adversaries, and does not assume secrecy. Rather, we prove that quantum non-malleability implies secrecy; this is in stark contrast to the classical setting, where the two properties are completely independent. For unitary schemes, our notion of non-malleability is equivalent to encryption with a two-design (and hence also to the definition of [6]).</p><p>Our techniques also yield new results regarding the closely-related task of quantum authentication. We show that \&ldquo;total authentication\&rdquo; (a notion recently proposed by Garg et al. [18]) can be satisfied with two-designs, a significant improvement over the eight-design construction of [18]. We also show that, under a mild adaptation of the rejection procedure, both total authentication and our notion of non-malleability yield quantum authentication as defined by Dupuis et al.

In the first, we propagate half of a singlet state through a chain of spin with a ferromagnetic interaction and subsequently recover the state with an antiferromagnetic interaction. The antiferromagnetic interaction is intrinsic to the system while the ferromagnetic one can be simulated by a sequence of time-dependent controls of the antiferromagnetic interaction and Suzuki-Trotter approximations. In the second test, we use the same technique to transfer a spin singlet state from one end of a spin chain to the other. We show that the tests are robust against parametric errors in operation of the simulator and may be applicable even without error correction.</p>},

This discovery allows us to classify quantum states according to their UD properties, with the requirement that each class be treated distinctly in the practice of simplifying quantum state tomography. Additionally we experimentally test the feasibility and stability of performing quantum state tomography via the measurement of local RDMs for each class.

This is the basis for device-independent quantum cryptography. In this paper we address a related question: does a superclassical score at G guarantee that one player has created randomness from the perspective of the other player? We show that for complete-support games, the answer is yes: even if the second player is given the first player\&$\#$39;s input at the conclusion of the game, he cannot perfectly recover her output. Thus some amount of local randomness (i.e., randomness possessed by only one player) is always obtained when randomness is certified from nonlocal games with quantum strategies. This is in contrast to non-signaling game strategies, which may produce global randomness without any local randomness. We discuss potential implications for cryptographic protocols between mistrustful parties.</span></p>},

The benchmarking of these devices has been controversial. Initially, random spin-glass problems were used, however, these were quickly shown to be not well suited to detect any quantum speedup. Subsequently, benchmarking shifted to carefully crafted synthetic problems designed to highlight the quantum nature of the hardware while (often) ensuring that classical optimization techniques do not perform well on them. Even worse, to date a true sign of improved scaling with the number problem variables remains elusive when compared to classical optimization techniques. Here, we analyze the readiness of quantum annealing machines for real-world application problems. These are typically not random and have an underlying structure that is hard to capture in synthetic benchmarks, thus posing unexpected challenges for optimization techniques, both classical and quantum alike. We present a comprehensive computational scaling analysis of fault diagnosis in digital circuits, considering architectures beyond D-wave quantum annealers. We find that the instances generated from real data in multiplier circuits are harder than other representative random spin-glass benchmarks with a comparable number of variables. Although our results show that transverse-field quantum annealing is outperformed by state-of-the-art classical optimization algorithms, these benchmark instances are hard and small in the size of the input, therefore representing the first industrial application ideally suited for near-term quantum annealers.</span></p>},

Rigidity has a vital role in quantum cryptography as it permits a strictly classical user to trust behavior in the quantum realm. This property can be traced back as far as 1998 (Mayers and Yao) and has been proved for multiple classes of games. In this paper we prove ridigity for the magic pentagram game, a simple binary constraint satisfaction game involving two players, five clauses and ten variables. We show that all near-optimal strategies for the pentagram game are approximately equivalent to a unique strategy involving real Pauli measurements on three maximally-entangled qubit pairs.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>A method to study strongly interacting quantum many-body systems at and away from criticality is proposed. The method is based on a MERA-like tensor network that can be efficiently and reliably contracted on a noisy quantum computer using a number of qubits that is much smaller than the system size. We prove that the outcome of the contraction is stable to noise and that the estimated energy upper bounds the ground state energy. The stability, which we numerically substantiate, follows from the positivity of operator scaling dimensions under renormalization group flow. The variational upper bound follows from a particular assignment of physical qubits to different locations of the tensor network plus the assumption that the noise model is local. We postulate a scaling law for how well the tensor network can approximate ground states of lattice regulated conformal field theories in d spatial dimensions and provide evidence for the postulate. Under this postulate, a O(logd (1/δ))-qubit quantum computer can prepare a valid quantum-mechanical state with energy density δ above the ground state. In the presence of noise, δ = O( logd+1(1/)) can be achieved, where  is the noise strength.</p>},

	abstract = {<p><span style="font-family: \&quot;Lucida Grande\&quot;, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px;">We describe two procedures which, given access to one copy of a quantum state and a sequence of two-outcome measurements, can distinguish between the case that at least one of the measurements accepts the state with high probability, and the case that all of the measurements have low probability of acceptance. The measurements cannot simply be tried in sequence, because early measurements may disturb the state being tested. One procedure is based on a variant of Marriott-Watrous amplification. The other procedure is based on the use of a test for this disturbance, which is applied with low probability. We find a number of applications. First, quantum query complexity separations in the property testing model for testing isomorphism of functions under group actions. We give quantum algorithms for testing isomorphism, linear isomorphism and affine isomorphism of boolean functions which use exponentially fewer queries than is possible classically, and a quantum algorithm for testing graph isomorphism which uses polynomially fewer queries than the best algorithm known. Second, testing properties of quantum states and operations. We show that any finite property of quantum states can be tested using a number of copies of the state which is logarithmic in the size of the property, and give a test for genuine multipartite entanglement of states of n qubits that uses O(n) copies of the state. Third, correcting an error in a result of Aaronson on de-Merlinizing quantum protocols. This result claimed that, in any one-way quantum communication protocol where two parties are assisted by an all-powerful but untrusted third party, the third party can be removed with only a modest increase in the communication cost.

We show arguments in support of using -CZ- stages over the -C- stages: not only the use of -CZ- stages allows a shorter layered expression, but -CZ- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement compared to the -C- stages. Based on this decomposition, we develop a twoqubit gate depth-(14n\&minus;4) implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate library {H, P, CNOT}, executable in the LNN architecture, improving best previously known depth-25n circuit, also executable in the LNN architecture. Our constructions rely on Bruhat decomposition of the symplectic group and on folding arbitrarily long sequences of the form (-P-C-) m into a 3-stage computation -P-CZ-C-.

This reduction is based on the Bruhat decomposition of the symplectic group. This result also implies a new normal form for stabilizer circuits.

Singlephoton-like light is often characterized by its brightness, as well as two quantum properties: the suppression of multiphoton content and the photon indistinguishability. While it is desirable to obtain these quantities from a single measurement, currently two or more measurements are required. Here, we show that using two-photon (n \&frac14; 2) number-resolving detectors, one can completely characterize single-photon-like states in a single measurement, where previously two or more measurements were necessary.

We find n \&ge; 3 number-resolving detectors provide no additional advantage in the single-photon characterization. The new method extracts more information per experimental trial than a conventional measurement for all input states and is particularly more efficient for statistical mixtures of photon states.

In SSMC, a population of walkers is initialized according to a known distribution on an arbitrary search space and varied into the solution of some optimization problem of interest. The first argument of this paper shows how an existing classical algorithm, \&quot;Go-With-The-Winners\&quot; (GWW), is a limiting case of SSMC when restricted to binary search and particular driving dynamics.\&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: \&quot;Lucida Grande\&quot;, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px;" /><span style="font-family: \&quot;Lucida Grande\&quot;, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px;">Although limiting to GWW, SSMC is more general. We show that (1) GWW can be efficiently simulated within the SSMC framework, (2) SSMC can be exponentially faster than GWW, (3) by naturally incorporating structural information, SSMC can exponentially outperform the quantum algorithm that first inspired it, and (4) SSMC exhibits desirable search features in general spaces.

	abstract = {<p>Recent work on quantum machine learning has demonstrated that quantum computers can offer dramatic improvements over classical devices for data mining, prediction and classification. However, less is known about the advantages using quantum computers may bring in the more general setting of reinforcement learning, where learning is achieved via interaction with a task environment that provides occasional rewards. Reinforcement learning can incorporate data-analysis-oriented learning settings as special cases, but also includes more complex situations where, e.g., reinforcing feedback is delayed. In a few recent works, Grover-type amplification has been utilized to construct quantum agents that achieve up-to-quadratic improvements in learning efficiency. These encouraging results have left open the key question of whether super-polynomial improvements in learning times are possible for genuine reinforcement learning problems, that is problems that go beyond the other more restricted learning paradigms. In this work, we provide a family of such genuine reinforcement learning tasks. We construct quantum-enhanced learners which learn super-polynomially, and even exponentially faster than any classical reinforcement learning model, and we discuss the potential impact our results may have on future technologies.</p>},

Classically, security games use string copying and comparison to detect adversarial cheating in such scenarios. Quantumly, this approach would violate no-cloning. We develop new techniques to overcome this problem: we use entanglement to detect cheating, and rely on recent results for characterizing quantum encryption schemes. We give definitions for (i.) ciphertext unforgeability , (ii.) indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack, and (iii.) authenticated encryption. The restriction of each definition to the classical setting is at least as strong as the corresponding classical notion: (i) implies INT-CTXT, (ii) implies IND-CCA2, and (iii) implies AE. All of our new notions also imply QIND-CPA privacy. Combining one-time authentication and classical pseudorandomness, we construct schemes for each of these new quantum security notions, and provide several separation examples. Along the way, we also give a new definition of one-time quantum authentication which, unlike all previous approaches, authenticates ciphertexts rather than plaintexts.</span></p>},

In this paper, working within the broad class of spot-checking protocols, we prove exactly which Bell inequality violations can be used to achieve full security. Our result greatly improves the known noise tolerance for secure randomness expansion: for the commonly used CHSH game, full security was only known with a noise tolerance of 1.5\%, and we improve this to 10.3\%. We also generalize our results beyond Bell inequalities and give the first security proof for randomness expansion based on Kochen-Specker inequalities. The central technical contribution of the paper is a new uncertainty principle for the Schatten norm, which is based on the uniform convexity inequality of Ball, Carlen, and Lieb (Inventiones mathematicae, 115:463-482, 1994).</span></p>},

Comparing bias triangles (i.e., regions of allowed current in DQDs) at positive and negative bias voltages we find a systematic asymmetry in the size of the bias triangles at the two bias polarities. Asymmetries of this nature are associated with blocking of tunneling events due to the occupation of a metastable state. Several features of our data lead us to conclude that the states involved are not simple spin states. Rather, we develop a model based on selective filling of valley states in the DQD that is consistent with all of the qualitative features of our data.</span></p>},

This raises a question as to whether classical Monte Carlo methods can simulate stoquastic adiabatic algorithms with polynomial overhead. Here, we analyze diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms. We argue that, based on differences between L1 and L2 normalized states, these algorithms suffer from certain obstructions preventing them from efficiently simulating stoquastic adiabatic evolution in generality. In practice however, we obtain good performance by introducing a method that we call Substochastic Monte Carlo. In fact, our simulations are good classical optimization algorithms in their own right, competitive with the best previously known heuristic solvers for MAX-k-SAT at k=2,3,4.</span></p>},

It was commonly believed that the relative phase deviations would prevent the relative phase Toffolis from being very helpful in practical large-scale designs. 
In this paper, we report three circuit identities that provide the means for replacing certain configurations of the multiple control Toffoli gates with their simpler relative phase implementations, up to a selectable unitary on certain qubits, and without changing the overall functionality. We illustrate the advantage via applying those identities to the optimization of the known circuits implementing multiple control Toffoli gates, and report the reductions in the CNOT-count, T-count, as well as the number of ancillae used. We suggest that a further study of the relative phase Toffoli implementations and their use may yield other optimizations.},

We attribute the increased linewidth to resonant dipole-dipole interactions of 18s atoms with spontaneously created populations of nearby np states. Over a range of initial atomic densities and excitation strengths, the transition width is described by a single function of the steady-state density of Rydberg atoms, and the observed resonant excitation rate corresponds to that of a two-level system with the measured, rather than natural, linewidth. The broadening mechanism observed here is likely to have negative implications for many proposals with coherently interacting Rydberg atoms.},

characterize their response to local perturbations. We deduce the dynamic
critical exponent, up to the two-loop order within the renormalization group

that beyond a critical value of the power-law exponent of long-range

As consequences, we establish that QMA with exponentially small completeness-soundness gap is equal to PSPACE, that determining whether a local Hamiltonian is frustration-free is PSPACE-complete, and give a provable setting in which the ability to prepare PEPS states gives less computational power than the ability to prepare the ground state of a generic local Hamiltonian.},

In this direction, we establish quantum versions of several fundamental classical results. First, we develop natural definitions for private-key and public-key encryption schemes for quantum data. We then define notions of semantic security and indistinguishability, and, in analogy with the classical work of Goldwasser and Micali, show that these notions are equivalent.

Small quantum algorithms have been demonstrated on multiple quantum computing platforms, many specifically tailored in hardware to implement a particular algorithm or execute a limited number of computational paths. Here, we demonstrate a five-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer that can be programmed in software to implement arbitrary quantum algorithms by executing any sequence of universal quantum logic gates. We compile algorithms into a fully-connected set of gate operations that are native to the hardware and have a mean fidelity of 98 \%. Reconfiguring these gate sequences provides the flexibility to implement a variety of algorithms without altering the hardware. As examples, we implement the Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) and Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) algorithms with average success rates of 95 \% and 90 \%, respectively. We also perform a coherent quantum Fourier transform (QFT) on five trappedion qubits for phase estimation and period finding with average fidelities of 62 \% and 84 \%, respectively. This small quantum computer can be scaled to larger numbers of qubits within a single register, and can be further expanded by connecting several such modules through ion shuttling or photonic quantum channels.</span></p>},

Nanoscale quantum devices allow the interplay of confined electrons, phonons, and photons to be studied under strong driving conditions. Here we show that a single electron in a periodically driven DQD functions as a \&quot;Floquet gain medium,\&quot; where population imbalances in the DQD Floquet quasi-energy levels lead to an intricate pattern of gain and loss features in the cavity response. We further measure a large intra-cavity photon number n_c in the absence of a cavity drive field, due to equilibration in the Floquet picture. Our device operates in the absence of a dc current -- one and the same electron is repeatedly driven to the excited state to generate population inversion. These results pave the way to future studies of non-classical light and thermalization of driven quantum systems.</span></p>},

However, many experimental systems have interactions that decay with distance, and the achievable benefits in this context are much less clear. Combining recent exact solutions with a controlled expansion in the system size, we analyze quench dynamics in Ising models with power-law (1/r α ) interactions in D dimensions, thereby expanding the understanding of spin squeezing into a broad and experimentally relevant context. In spatially homogeneous systems, we show that for small α the scaling of squeezing with system size is identical to the infinite-range (α = 0) case. This indifference to the interaction range persists up to a critical value α = 2D/3, above which squeezing degrades continuously. Boundaryinduced inhomogeneities present in most experimental systems modify this picture, but it nevertheless remains qualitatively correct for finite-sized systems.</p>},

In order to make quantum information robust to errors introduced by qubit imperfections and flawed control operations, QEC protocols encode a logical qubit in multiple physical qubits. This redundancy allows the extraction of error syndromes and the subsequent correction or detection of errors without destroying the logical state itself through direct measurement. While several experiments have shown a reduction of high intrinsic or artificially introduced errors in logical qubits, fault-tolerant encoding of a logical qubit has never been demonstrated. Here we show the encoding and syndrome measurement of a fault-tolerant logical qubit via an error detection protocol on four physical qubits, represented by trapped atomic ions. This demonstrates for the first time the robustness of a fault-tolerant qubit to imperfections in the very operations used to encode it. This advantage persists in the face of large added error rates and experimental calibration errors.</span></p>},

An exponential separation in the other direction was already known from the work of Kerenidis et. al. [SICOMP 44, pp. 1550-1572], hence our work implies that these two complexity measures are incomparable. As classical information complexity is an upper bound on quantum information complexity, which in turn is equal to amortized quantum communication complexity, our work implies that a tight direct sum result for distributional quantum communication complexity cannot hold. The function we use to present such a separation is the Symmetric k-ary Pointer Jumping function introduced by Rao and Sinha [ECCC TR15-057], whose classical communication complexity is exponentially larger than its classical information complexity. In this paper, we show that the quantum communication complexity of this function is polynomially equivalent to its classical communication complexity. The high-level idea behind our proof is arguably the simplest so far for such an exponential separation between information and communication, driven by a sequence of round-elimination arguments, allowing us to simplify further the approach of Rao and Sinha.\&nbsp;<br />As another application of the techniques that we develop, we give a simple proof for an optimal trade-off between Alice\&$\#$39;s and Bob\&$\#$39;s communication while computing the related Greater-Than function on n bits: say Bob communicates at most b bits, then Alice must send n/exp(O(b)) bits to Bob. This holds even when allowing pre-shared entanglement. We also present a classical protocol achieving this bound.</blockquote><div>\&nbsp;</div><div class="metatable" style="font-size: 12.96px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 20px; font-family: \&quot;Lucida Grande\&quot;, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;">\&nbsp;</div>},

Such hybrid systems have demonstrated frequency conversion of classical signals and have the potential of enabling quantum state transfer, e.g., between superconducting circuits and traveling optical signals. This Letter describes a simple approach for the theoretical characterization of performance for quantum transducers. Given that, in practice, one cannot attain ideal one-to-one quantum conversion, we will explore how well the transducer performs in various scenarios ranging from classical signal detection to applications for quantum information processing. While the performance of the transducer depends on the particular application in which it enters, we show that the performance can be characterized by defining two simple parameters: the signal transfer efficiency\&nbsp;</span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" style="display: inline; line-height: normal; font-size: 14.4px; word-wrap: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; font-family: \&quot;Lucida Grande\&quot;, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;" tabindex="0"><nobr style="transition: none; border: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal;"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" role="math" style="transition: none; display: inline-block; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; width: 0.639em;"><span style="transition: none; display: inline-block; position: relative; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; width: 0.524em; height: 0px; font-size: 17.28px;"><span style="transition: none; position: absolute; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; clip: rect(1.276em 1000.52em 2.318em -999.997em); top: -1.907em; left: 0.003em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2" style="transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal;"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-3" style="transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">η</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><span style="font-family: \&quot;Lucida Grande\&quot;, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px;">\&nbsp;and the added noise\&nbsp;</span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame" style="display: inline; line-height: normal; font-size: 14.4px; word-wrap: normal; white-space: nowrap; float: none; direction: ltr; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; font-family: \&quot;Lucida Grande\&quot;, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;" tabindex="0"><nobr style="transition: none; border: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; max-width: none; max-height: none; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal;"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-4" role="math" style="transition: none; display: inline-block; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; width: 1.045em;"><span style="transition: none; display: inline-block; position: relative; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; width: 0.871em; height: 0px; font-size: 17.28px;"><span style="transition: none; position: absolute; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; clip: rect(1.045em 1000.87em 2.086em -999.997em); top: -1.907em; left: 0.003em;"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-5" style="transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal;"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-6" style="transition: none; display: inline; position: static; vertical-align: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: MathJax_Math-italic;">N</span></span></span></span></span></nobr></span><span style="font-family: \&quot;Lucida Grande\&quot;, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px;">.</span></p>},

to the system. However, symmetry considerations may forbid a linear coupling,
e.g. for a neutral particle in quantum electrodynamics. We argue that nonlinear
couplings can lead to a fundamentally different behavior. Specifically, we
consider a heavy particle quadratically coupled to quantum fluctuations of the
bath. In one dimension the particle undergoes anomalous diffusion, unfolding as
a power-law distribution in space, reminiscent of L\'{e}vy flights. We suggest
condensed matter analogs where similar effects may arise.

Here, we investigate the degree to which these two properties are connected. We examine four classes of deviations from quantum mechanics, for which we draw inspiration from the literature on the black hole information paradox: nonunitary dynamics, non-Born-rule measurement, cloning, and postselection. We find that each model admits superluminal signaling if and only if it admits a query complexity speedup over Grover\&$\#$39;s algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the physical resources required to send a superluminal signal scale polynomially with the resources needed to speed up Grover\&$\#$39;s algorithm.

We determine the strength of the two- and three-body interactions for scattering from van-der-Waals potentials and near Fano-Feshbach resonances. For van-der-Waals potentials, which for example describe scattering of alkaline-earth atoms, we find that the pair-wise interaction can only be turned off for species with a small negative scattering length, leaving the 88Sr isotope a possible candidate. Interestingly, for collisional magnetic Feshbach resonances this restriction does not apply and there often exist magnetic fields where the two-body interaction is small. We illustrate this result for several known narrow resonances between alkali-metal atoms as well as chromium atoms.

In this limit, we employ Luttinger liquid theory and find an analogy with the superconducting phase-slip qubit, in which the topological charge associated with persistent currents can be put into superposition.

This allows us to identify the reduced density matrix geometry with joint product numerical range Π of the Hamiltonian interaction terms. We focus on the case where the interaction terms have certain structures, such that ruled surface emerge naturally when taking a convex hull of Π. We show that, a ruled surface on ∂Θ sitting in Π has a gapless origin, otherwise it has a symmetry breaking origin. As an example, we demonstrate that a famous ruled surface, known as the oloid, is a possible shape of Θ, with two boundary pieces of symmetry breaking origin separated by two gapless lines.},

In the absence of long-range interactions, varying the spin-coupling anisotropy leads to four distinct phases: a ferromagnetic Ising phase, a disordered XY phase, a topological Haldane phase, and an antiferromagnetic Ising phase. If long-range interactions are antiferromagnetic and thus frustrated, we find primarily a quantitative change of the phase boundaries. On the other hand, ferromagnetic (non-frustrated) long-range interactions qualitatively impact the entire phase diagram. Importantly, for α≲3, long-range interactions destroy the Haldane phase, break the conformal symmetry of the XY phase, give rise to a new phase that spontaneously breaks a U(1) continuous symmetry, and introduce an exotic tricritical point with no direct parallel in short-range interacting spin chains. We show that the main signatures of all five phases found could be observed experimentally in the near future.

Our approach provides a photonic analogue to the Landauer transport formula, and using non-equilbrium Green\&$\#$39;s functions, we can extend it to the case of an interacting region between two photonic {\textquoteleft}leads\&$\#$39; where the sinusoid frequency plays the role of a voltage bias. Crucially, we identify both the mathematical framework and the physical regime in which photonic transport is directly analogous to electronic transport, and regimes in which other new behavior such as two-mode squeezing can emerge.</span></p>},

	abstract = {Conformal field theory has turned out to be a powerful tool to derive two-dimensional lattice models displaying fractional quantum Hall physics. So far most of the work has been for lattices with open boundary conditions in at least one of the two directions, but it is desirable to also be able to handle the case of periodic boundary conditions. Here, we take steps in this direction by deriving analytical expressions for a family of conformal field theory states on the torus that is closely related to the family of bosonic and fermionic Laughlin states. We compute how the states transform when a particle is moved around the torus and when the states are translated or rotated, and we provide numerical evidence in particular cases that the states become orthonormal up to a common factor for large lattices. We use these results to find the S -matrix of the states, which turns out to be the same as for the continuum Laughlin states. Finally, we show that when the states are defined on a square lattice with suitable lattice spacing they practically coincide with the Laughlin states restricted to a lattice.},

	abstract = {<p>When a system thermalizes it loses all local memory of its initial conditions. This is a general feature of open systems and is well described by equilibrium statistical mechanics. Even within a closed (or reversible) quantum system, where unitary time evolution retains all information about its initial state, subsystems can still thermalize using the rest of the system as an effective heat bath. Exceptions to quantum thermalization have been predicted and observed, but typically require inherent symmetries or noninteracting particles in the presence of static disorder. The prediction of many-body localization (MBL), in which disordered quantum systems can fail to thermalize in spite of strong interactions and high excitation energy, was therefore surprising and has attracted considerable theoretical attention. Here we experimentally generate MBL states by applying an Ising Hamiltonian with long-range interactions and programmably random disorder to ten spins initialized far from equilibrium. We observe the essential signatures of MBL: memory retention of the initial state, a Poissonian distribution of energy level spacings, and entanglement growth in the system at long times. Our platform can be scaled to higher numbers of spins, where detailed modeling of MBL becomes impossible due to the complexity of representing such entangled quantum states. Moreover, the high degree of control in our experiment may guide the use of MBL states as potential quantum memories in naturally disordered quantum systems.</p>},

	year = {2016},
	abstract = {Current quantum annealing (QA) hardware suffers from practical limitations such as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and control error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In particular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a hardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two new decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly into hardware. 
The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising models are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in different constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In contrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising model for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to generate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of CSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave{\textquoteright}s QA hardware using the local mapping technique is significantly better than global embedding. 
We validate the approach by applying D-Wave{\textquoteright}s hardware to circuit-based fault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is typically able to find all solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N using 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a leading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms to find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than can be solved directly on current hardware.},

While there has been a surge of theoretical works on the subject, no experimental measurement has been performed to date because of the lack of an implementable measurement scheme. Here, we propose a measurement protocol to access the entanglement spectrum of many-body states in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices. Our scheme effectively performs a Ramsey spectroscopy of the entanglement Hamiltonian and is based on the ability to produce several copies of the state under investigation together with the possibility to perform a global swap gate between two copies conditioned on the state of an auxiliary qubit. We show how the required conditional swap gate can be implemented with cold atoms, either by using Rydberg interactions or coupling the atoms to a cavity mode. We illustrate these ideas on a simple (extended) Bose-Hubbard model where such a measurement protocol reveals topological features of the Haldane phase.\&nbsp;</p>},

rich class of models which are nevertheless much less explored than their
dissipationless counterparts. The advent of numerous experimental platforms
that simulate such dynamics poses an immediate challenge to systematically
understand and classify these models. In particular, nontrivial many-body
states emerge as steady states under non-equilibrium dynamics. While these
states and their phase transitions have been studied extensively with mean
field theory, the validity of the mean field approximation has not been
systematically investigated. In this paper, we employ a field-theoretic
approach based on the Keldysh formalism to study nonequilibrium phases and
phase transitions in a variety of models. In all cases, a complete description
via the Keldysh formalism indicates a partial or complete failure of the mean
field analysis. Furthermore, we find that an effective temperature emerges as a
result of dissipation, and the universal behavior including the dynamics near
the steady state is generically described by a thermodynamic universality
class.

For instance, quantum systems that are near-integrable usually fail to thermalize in an experimentally realistic time scale and, instead, relax to quasi-stationary prethermal states that can be described by statistical mechanics when approximately conserved quantities are appropriately included in a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Here we experimentally study the relaxation dynamics of a chain of up to 22 spins evolving under a long-range transverse field Ising Hamiltonian following a sudden quench. For sufficiently long-ranged interactions the system relaxes to a new type of prethermal state that retains a strong memory of the initial conditions. In this case, the prethermal state cannot be described by a GGE, but rather arises from an emergent double-well potential felt by the spin excitations. This result shows that prethermalization occurs in a significantly broader context than previously thought, and reveals new challenges for a generic understanding of the thermalization of quantum systems, particularly in the presence of long-range interactions.</span></p>},

	abstract = {  Nonlinear variants of quantum mechanics can solve tasks that are impossible
in standard quantum theory, such as perfectly distinguishing nonorthogonal
states. Here we derive the optimal protocol for distinguishing two states of a
qubit using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a model of nonlinear quantum
mechanics that arises as an effective description of Bose-Einstein condensates.
Using this protocol, we present an algorithm for unstructured search in the
Gross-Pitaevskii model, obtaining an exponential improvement over a previous
algorithm of Meyer and Wong. This result establishes a limitation on the
effectiveness of the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation. More generally, we
demonstrate similar behavior under a family of related nonlinearities, giving
evidence that the ability to quickly discriminate nonorthogonal states and
thereby solve unstructured search is a generic feature of nonlinear quantum
mechanics.

	abstract = {We consider constraint satisfaction problems of bounded degree, with a good notion of "typicality", e.g. the negation of the variables in each constraint is taken independently at random. Using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), we show that μ+Ω(1/D--√) fraction of the constraints can be satisfied for typical instances, with the assignment efficiently produced by QAOA. We do so by showing that the averaged fraction of constraints being satisfied is μ+Ω(1/D--√), with small variance. Here μ is the fraction that would be satisfied by a uniformly random assignment, and D is the number of constraints that each variable can appear. CSPs with typicality include Max-kXOR and Max-kSAT. We point out how it can be applied to determine the typical ground-state energy of some local Hamiltonians. We also give a similar result for instances with "no overlapping constraints", using the quantum algorithm. We sketch how the classical algorithm might achieve some partial result.},

	year = {2016},
	month = {2016/02/04},
	abstract = {Encryption of data is fundamental to secure communication in the modern world. Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of functionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating classical programs, so-called {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}black-box obfuscation{\textquoteright},{\textquoteright} is provably impossible [Barak et al {\textquoteright}12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate schemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have numerous applications. 
In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via quantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which encompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe classical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description or a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of obfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box, indistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three variants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many applications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum fully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money. 
We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of foundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove that quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries can possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic transformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits is impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation is impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse. Our proofs involve a new tool: chosen-ciphertext-secure encryption of quantum data, which was recently shown to be possible assuming quantum-secure one-way functions exist [Alagic et al {\textquoteright}16].},

Our approach is general and covers all three main branches of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. While quantum improvements in supervised and unsupervised learning have been reported, reinforcement learning has received much less attention. Within our approach, we tackle the problem of quantum enhancements in reinforcement learning as well, and propose a systematic scheme for providing improvements.

Dynamic suppression of this scattering loss can lift constraints on device structure and can improve tolerance to defects in the material, even after fabrication. Inspired by recent experiments, here we introduce a model of phonon losses resulting from disorder in a whispering gallery mode resonator with acousto-optical coupling between optical and mechanical modes. We show that a typical elastic scattering mechanism of high quality factor (Q) mechanical modes flips the direction of phonon propagation via high-angle scattering, leading to damping into modes with the opposite parity. When the optical mode overlaps co-propagating high-Q and bulk mechanical modes, the addition of laser cooling via sideband-resolved damping of the mechanical mode of a chosen parity also damps and modifies the response of the bulk modes of the same parity. This, in turn, simultaneously improves the quality factor and reduces the thermal load of the counter-propagating high-Q modes, leading to the dynamical creation of a cold phononic shield. We compare our theoretical results to the recent experiments of Kim et al., and find quantitative agreement with our theory.</span></p>},

A wide range of applications critically rely on abundant, high-quality random numbers generated securely. Here, we show how to expand a random seed at an exponential rate without trusting the underlying quantum devices. Our approach is secure against the most general adversaries, and has the following new features: cryptographic level of security, tolerating a constant level of imprecision in devices, requiring only unit size quantum memory (for each device component) in an honest implementation, and allowing a large natural class of constructions for the protocol. In conjunction with a recent work by Chung et al. [2014], it also leads to robust unbounded expansion using just 2 multipart devices. When adapted for distributing cryptographic keys, our method achieves, for the first time, exponential expansion combined with cryptographic security and noise tolerance. The proof proceeds by showing that the R{\'e}nyi divergence of the outputs of the protocol (for a specific bounding operator) decreases linearly as the protocol iterates. At the heart of the proof are a new uncertainty principle on quantum measurements and a method for simulating trusted measurements with untrusted devices.</span></p>},

The reduced widths stem from the nonlinear atomic response to control fields that create spatially varying dark resonances. The subwavelength barrier is the result of the geometric scalar potential experienced by an atom prepared in such a spatially varying dark state. The performance of this technique, as well as its applications to the study of many-body physics and to the implementation of quantum-information protocols with ultracold atoms, are discussed, with a focus on the implementation of tunnel junctions.</span></p>},

	abstract = {<p>We determine the exact time evolution of an initial Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state of ultra-cold atoms in a hexagonal optical lattice. The dynamical evolution is triggered by ramping the lattice potential up, such that the interaction strength Uf is much larger than the hopping amplitude Jf. The quench initiates collective oscillations with frequency |Uf|/(2π) in the momentum occupation numbers and imprints an oscillating phase with the same frequency on the order parameter Δ. The latter is not reproduced by treating the time evolution in mean-field theory. The momentum density-density or noise correlation functions oscillate at frequency |Uf|/2π as well as its second harmonic. For a very deep lattice, with negligible tunneling energy, the oscillations of momentum occupation numbers are undamped. Non-zero tunneling after the quench leads to dephasing of the different momentum modes and a subsequent damping of the oscillations. This occurs even for a finite-temperature initial BCS state, but not for a non-interacting Fermi gas. We therefore propose to use this dephasing to detect a BCS state. Finally, we predict that the noise correlation functions in a honeycomb lattice will develop strong anti-correlations near the Dirac point.</p>},

A natural question of both theoretical and experimental importance is whether universal entanglement detection is possible without full state tomography. In this work, we prove a no-go theorem that rules out this possibility for any non-adaptive schemes that employ single-copy measurements only. We also examine in detail a previously implemented experiment, which claimed to detect entanglement of two-qubit states via adaptive single-copy measurements without full state tomography. By performing the experiment and analyzing the data, we demonstrate that the information gathered is indeed sufficient to reconstruct the state. These results reveal a fundamental limit for single-copy measurements in entanglement detection, and provides a general framework to study the detection of other interesting properties of quantum states, such as the positivity of partial transpose and the k-symmetric extendibility.},

systems with short-range interactions. Whether various topological phases can
survive in the presence of long-range interactions, however, is largely
unknown. Here we show that a paradigmatic example of a symmetry-protected
topological phase, the Haldane phase of an antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain,
surprisingly remains intact in the presence of arbitrarily slowly decaying
power-law interactions. The influence of long-range interactions on the
topological order is largely quantitative, and we expect similar results for
more general systems. Our conclusions are based on large-scale
matrix-product-state simulations and two complementary effective-field-theory
calculations. The striking agreement between the numerical and analytical
results rules out finite-size effects. The topological phase considered here
should be experimentally observable in a recently developed trapped-ion quantum
simulator.

This result gives a new method to upper bound the quantum query complexity: we give a method of finding bomb query algorithms from classical algorithms, which then provide nonconstructive upper bounds on $Q(f)=\Theta(\sqrt{B(f)})$. We subsequently were able to give explicit quantum algorithms matching our upper bound method. We apply this method on the single-source shortest paths problem on unweighted graphs, obtaining an algorithm with $O(n^{1.5})$ quantum query complexity, improving the best known algorithm of $O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ [arXiv:quant-ph/0606127]. Applying this method to the maximum bipartite matching problem gives an $O(n^{1.75})$ algorithm, improving the best known trivial $O(n^2)$ upper bound.</p>},

In contrast to prior work, here we focus on a regime with strong interactions between the qubits. The interplay of the interaction energy and simultaneous large detunings for both double dots gives rise to the double charge resonant regime, in which the unpolarized (1111) and fully polarized (0202) four-electron states in the absence of interqubit tunneling are near degeneracy, while being energetically well-separated from the partially polarized (0211 and 1102) states. A controlled-phase gate may be realized by combining time evolution in this regime in the presence of intraqubit tunneling and the interqubit Coulomb interaction with refocusing {\pi} pulses that swap the singly occupied singlet and triplet states of the two qubits via, e.g., magnetic gradients. We calculate the fidelity of this entangling gate, incorporating models for two types of noise - classical, Gaussian-distributed charge fluctuations in the single-qubit detunings and charge relaxation within the low-energy subspace via electron-phonon interaction - and identify parameter regimes that optimize the fidelity. The rates of phonon-induced decay for pairs of GaAs or Si double quantum dots vary with the sizes of the dipolar and quadrupolar contributions and are several orders of magnitude smaller for Si, leading to high theoretical gate fidelities for coupled singlet-triplet qubits in Si dots. We also consider the dependence of the capacitive coupling on the relative orientation of the double dots and find that a linear geometry provides the fastest potential gate.

Using bosonization and renormalization group theory, we find CSB for α smaller than a critical exponent αc(<=3) depending on the microscopic parameters of the model. Furthermore, the transition from the gapless XY phase to the gapless CSB phase is mediated by the breaking of conformal symmetry due to long-range interactions, and is described by a new universality class akin to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our analytical findings are in good agreement with a numerical calculation. Signatures of the CSB phase should be accessible in existing trapped-ion experiments.},

physical systems that meet the stringent requirements for creating and

entanglement is typically achieved by strong, long-range interactions in the
form of Coulomb interactions between ions or dipolar interactions between
Rydberg atoms. While these interactions allow fast gates, atoms subject to
these interactions must overcome the associated coupling to the environment and
cross-talk among qubits. Local interactions, such as those requiring
significant wavefunction overlap, can alleviate these detrimental effects yet
present a new challenge: To distribute entanglement, qubits must be
transported, merged for interaction, and then isolated for storage and
subsequent operations. Here we show how, via a mobile optical tweezer, it is
possible to prepare and locally entangle two ultracold neutral atoms, and then
separate them while preserving their entanglement. While ultracold neutral atom
experiments have measured dynamics consistent with spin entanglement, we are
now able to demonstrate two-particle coherence via application of a local
gradient and parity measurements; this new entanglement-verification protocol
could be applied to arbitrary spin-entangled states of spatially-separated
atoms. The local entangling operation is achieved via ultracold spin-exchange
interactions, and quantum tunneling is used to combine and separate atoms. Our
toolset provides a framework for dynamically entangling remote qubits via local

	abstract = {In this paper we provide a broad framework for describing learning agents in general quantum environments. We analyze the types of classically specified environments which allow for quantum enhancements in learning, by contrasting environments to quantum oracles. We show that whether or not quantum improvements are at all possible depends on the internal structure of the quantum environment. If the environments are constructed and the internal structure is appropriately chosen, or if the agent has limited capacities to influence the internal states of the environment, we show that improvements in learning times are possible in a broad range of scenarios. Such scenarios we call luck-favoring settings. The case of constructed environments is particularly relevant for the class of model-based learning agents, where our results imply a near-generic improvement.

optimal dependence on the sparsity $d$ at the expense of poor scaling in the
allowed error $\epsilon$. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query
simulation provides optimal scaling in $\epsilon$ at the expense of poor
scaling in $d$. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features
of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with
coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm achieves near-linear
scaling in $\tau := d \|H\|_{\max} t$ and sublogarithmic scaling in
$1/\epsilon$. Our dependence on $\epsilon$ is optimal, and we prove a new lower
bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $\tau$.

recently demonstrated a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) micromaser where
photons are generated through single electron tunneling events. Charge noise
directly couples to the DQD energy levels, resulting in a maser linewidth that
is more than 100 times larger than the Schawlow-Townes prediction. Here we
demonstrate a linewidth narrowing of more than a factor 10 by locking the DQD
emission to a coherent tone that is injected to the input port of the cavity.
We measure the injection locking range as a function of cavity input power and
show that it is in agreement with the Adler equation. The position and
amplitude of distortion sidebands that appear outside of the injection locking
range are quantitatively examined. Our results show that this unconventional
maser, which is impacted by strong charge noise and electron-phonon coupling,
is well described by standard laser models.

a BH Hamiltonian spanning the lowest two bands. Our effective Hamiltonian is
constructed from the ground state of the $N$-atom Hamiltonian for each unit

lowest bands. The model includes hopping between ground states of neighboring
unit cells. We show that such an effective Hamiltonian has strong three-body
interactions that can be easily tuned by changing the lattice parameters.
Finally, relying on numerical mean-field simulations, we show that the
effective Hamiltonian is an excellent approximation of the two-band BH
Hamiltonian over a wide range of lattice parameters, both in the superfluid and

velocity $v$ can be chosen such that the influence of any local perturbation is
approximately confined to within a distance $r$ until a time $t \sim r/v$,
thereby defining a linear light cone and giving rise to an emergent notion of
locality. In systems with power-law ($1/r^{\alpha}$) interactions, when
$\alpha$ exceeds the dimension $D$, an analogous bound confines influences to
within a distance $r$ only until a time $t\sim(\alpha/v)\log r$, suggesting
that the velocity, as calculated from the slope of the light cone, may grow
exponentially in time. We rule out this possibility; light cones of power-law
interacting systems are algebraic for $\alpha>2D$, becoming linear as
$\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. Our results impose strong new constraints on the
growth of correlations and the production of entangled states in a variety of
rapidly emerging, long-range interacting atomic, molecular, and optical

Mechanical systems, such as relays and buckling transition spring switches can yield similar stability by exploiting non-equilibrium phase transitions. Curiously, in the optical domain, observations of such phase transitions remain elusive. However, efforts to integrate optical and mechanical systems -- optomechanics -- suggest that a hybrid approach combining the quantum control of optical systems with the engineerability of mechanical systems may provide a new avenue for such explorations. Here we report the first observation of the buckling of an optomechanical system, in which transitions between stable mechanical states corresponding to both first- and second-order phase transitions are driven by varying laser power and detuning. Our results enable new applications in photonics and, given rapid progress in pushing optomechanical systems into the quantum regime, the potential for explorations of quantum phase transitions.</span></p>},

For far-IR light, we calculate the dipole matrix elements between the valley-orbit and spin-orbit split states for all the goup-V donors using effective mass theory. We then calculate the maximum rate and amount of electron-nuclear spin-polarization achievable through optical pumping with circularly polarized light. We find this approach is most promising for Bi donors due to their large spin-orbit and valley-orbit interactions. Using near-IR light, spin-selective excitation is possible for all the donors by driving a two-photon $\Lambda$-transition from the ground state to higher orbitals with even parity. We show that externally applied electric fields or strain allow similar, spin-selective $\Lambda$-transition to odd-parity excited states. We anticipate these results will be useful for future spectroscopic investigations of donors, quantum control and state preparation of donor spin qubits, and for developing a coherent interface between donor spin qubits and single photons.

	abstract = {  A line of work initiated by Terhal and DiVincenzo and Bremner, Jozsa, and
Shepherd, shows that quantum computers can efficiently sample from probability
distributions that cannot be exactly sampled efficiently on a classical
computer, unless the PH collapses. Aaronson and Arkhipov take this further by
considering a distribution that can be sampled efficiently by linear optical
quantum computation, that under two feasible conjectures, cannot even be
approximately sampled classically within bounded total variation distance,
unless the PH collapses.
  In this work we use Quantum Fourier Sampling to construct a class of
distributions that can be sampled by a quantum computer. We then argue that
these distributions cannot be approximately sampled classically, unless the PH
collapses, under variants of the Aaronson and Arkhipov conjectures.
  In particular, we show a general class of quantumly sampleable distributions
each of which is based on an "Efficiently Specifiable" polynomial, for which a
classical approximate sampler implies an average-case approximation. This class
of polynomials contains the Permanent but also includes, for example, the
Hamiltonian Cycle polynomial, and many other familiar $\#$P-hard polynomials.
  Although our construction, unlike that proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov,
likely requires a universal quantum computer, we are able to use this
additional power to weaken the conjectures needed to prove approximate sampling
hardness results.

	abstract = {  Optomechanical systems provide a unique platform for observing quantum
behavior of macroscopic objects. However, efforts towards realizing nonlinear
behavior at the single photon level have been inhibited by the small size of
the radiation pressure interaction. Here we show that it is not necessary to
reach the single-photon strong-coupling regime in order to realize significant
optomechanical nonlinearities. Instead, nonlinearities at the few quanta level
can be achieved, even with weak-coupling, in a two-mode optomechanical system
driven near instability. In this limit, we establish a new figure of merit for
realizing strong nonlinearity which scales with the single-photon
optomechanical coupling and the sideband resolution of the mechanical mode with
respect to the cavity linewidth. We find that current devices based on
optomechanical crystals, thought to be in the weak-coupling regime, can still
achieve strong quantum nonlinearity; enabling deterministic interactions
between single photons.

experimentally implemented quantum gates to produce operations that are close

tomography is a standard technique for estimating these errors, but is both
time consuming, (when one only wants to learn a few key parameters), and
requires resources, like perfect state preparation and measurement, that might
not be available. With the goal of efficiently estimating specific errors using
minimal resources, we develop a parameter estimation technique, which can gauge
two key parameters (amplitude and off-resonance errors) in a single-qubit gate
with provable robustness and efficiency. In particular, our estimates achieve
the optimal efficiency, Heisenberg scaling. Our main theorem making this
possible is a robust version of the phase estimation procedure of Higgins et

created by the spatial interference of the expanding toroidal BEC and a
reference BEC after release from all trapping potentials. We characterize the
interferometer when it contains a single particle, which is initially in a
coherent superposition of a torus and reference state, as well as when it
contains a many-body state in the mean-field approximation. The single-particle
picture is sufficient to explain the origin of the spirals, to relate the
phase-drop across the barrier to the geometry of a spiral, and to bound the
expansion times for which the {\it in-situ} phase can be accurately determined.
Mean-field estimates and numerical simulations show that the inter-atomic
interactions shorten the expansion time scales compared to the single-particle

constrained optimization problem that must be solved at every point in a

algorithm for solving the dual problem in one-dimensional, slab geometries. The
closure is only well-defined on the set of moments that are realizable from a
positive underlying distribution, and as the boundary of the realizable set is
approached, the dual problem becomes increasingly difficult to solve due to
ill-conditioning of the Hessian matrix. To improve the condition number of the
Hessian, we advocate the use of a change of polynomial basis, defined using a
Cholesky factorization of the Hessian, that permits solution of problems nearer
to the boundary of the realizable set. We also advocate a fixed quadrature
scheme, rather than adaptive quadrature, since the latter introduces
unnecessary expense and changes the computationally realizable set as the
quadrature changes. For very ill-conditioned problems, we use regularization to
make the optimization algorithm robust. We design a manufactured solution and
demonstrate that the adaptive-basis optimization algorithm reduces the need for
regularization. This is important since we also show that regularization slows,
and even stalls, convergence of the numerical simulation when refining the
space-time mesh. We also simulate two well-known benchmark problems. There we
find that our adaptive-basis, fixed-quadrature algorithm uses less
regularization than alternatives, although differences in the resulting
numerical simulations are more sensitive to the regularization strategy than to
the choice of basis.

the well-known mapping between hard-core bosons and spin systems, lets us prove
a related result for a class of 2-local Hamiltonians defined by graphs that

factoring algorithm and several other famous quantum algorithms with
exponential quantum speed-ups for solving Abelian hidden subgroup problems. We
show that all these different forms of quantum computation belong to a common
new restricted model of quantum operations that we call \emph{black-box
normalizer circuits}. To define these, we extend the previous model of
normalizer circuits [arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], which
are built of quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism and quadratic phase
gates associated to an Abelian group $G$. In previous works, the group $G$ is
always given in an explicitly decomposed form. In our model, we remove this
assumption and allow $G$ to be a black-box group. While standard normalizer
circuits were shown to be efficiently classically simulable
[arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], we find that normalizer
circuits are powerful enough to factorize and solve classically-hard problems
in the black-box setting. We further set upper limits to their computational
power by showing that decomposing finite Abelian groups is complete for the
associated complexity class. In particular, solving this problem renders
black-box normalizer circuits efficiently classically simulable by exploiting
the generalized stabilizer formalism in
[arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208]. Lastly, we employ our
connection to draw a few practical implications for quantum algorithm design:
namely, we give a no-go theorem for finding new quantum algorithms with
black-box normalizer circuits, a universality result for low-depth normalizer
circuits, and identify two other complete problems.

represents the first nontrivial application of Kuperberg{\textquoteright}s quantum algorithm

$O\big(\tau \frac{\log^2(\tau/\epsilon)}{\log\log(\tau/\epsilon)}n\big)$
additional 2-qubit gates, where $\tau = d^2 \|{H}\|_{\max} t$. Unlike previous
approaches based on product formulas, the query complexity is independent of
the number of qubits acted on, and for time-varying Hamiltonians, the gate
complexity is logarithmic in the norm of the derivative of the Hamiltonian. Our
algorithm is based on a significantly improved simulation of the continuous-
and fractional-query models using discrete quantum queries, showing that the
former models are not much more powerful than the discrete model even for very
small error. We also simplify the analysis of this conversion, avoiding the
need for a complex fault correction procedure. Our simplification relies on a
new form of "oblivious amplitude amplification" that can be applied even though
the reflection about the input state is unavailable. Finally, we prove new
lower bounds showing that our algorithms are optimal as a function of the

implement a massive-particle analog of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer where

expansion technique and demonstrate that our theoretical method accurately
captures the measured dependence of the spin dynamics on molecule number and on

microscopic understanding of the experiment. Our findings pave the way for

also compute the quantum noise by deriving the full statistics of the radiated

stochastic angular motion resulting from the fluctuating back-reaction
frictional torque. As a result, we find a quantum limit on the uncertainty of
the object{\textquoteright}s angular velocity in steady rotation. Finally, we show in some

systems with only short-range interactions, Lieb and Robinson derived a
constant-velocity bound that limits correlations to within a linear effective
light cone. However, little is known about the propagation speed in systems
with long-range interactions, since the best long-range bound is too loose to
give the correct light-cone shape for any known spin model and since analytic
solutions rarely exist. In this work, we experimentally determine the spatial
and time-dependent correlations of a far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body
system evolving under a long-range Ising- or XY-model Hamiltonian. For several
different interaction ranges, we extract the shape of the light cone and
measure the velocity with which correlations propagate through the system. In
many cases we find increasing propagation velocities, which violate the
Lieb-Robinson prediction, and in one instance cannot be explained by any
existing theory. Our results demonstrate that even modestly-sized quantum

	abstract = {  $\textit{Normalizer circuits}$ [1,2] are generalized Clifford circuits that
act on arbitrary finite-dimensional systems $\mathcal{H}_{d_1}\otimes ...
\otimes \mathcal{H}_{d_n}$ with a standard basis labeled by the elements of a
finite Abelian group $G=\mathbb{Z}_{d_1}\times... \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_n}$.
Normalizer gates implement operations associated with the group $G$ and can be
of three types: quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism gates and
quadratic phase gates. In this work, we extend the normalizer formalism [1,2]
to infinite dimensions, by allowing normalizer gates to act on systems of the
form $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Z}^{\otimes a}$: each factor $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Z}$
has a standard basis labeled by $\textit{integers}$ $\mathbb{Z}$, and a Fourier
basis labeled by $\textit{angles}$, elements of the circle group $\mathbb{T}$.
Normalizer circuits become hybrid quantum circuits acting both on continuous-
and discrete-variable systems. We show that infinite-dimensional normalizer
circuits can be efficiently simulated classically with a generalized
$\textit{stabilizer formalism}$ for Hilbert spaces associated with groups of
the form $\mathbb{Z}^a\times \mathbb{T}^b \times
\mathbb{Z}_{d_1}\times...\times \mathbb{Z}_{d_n}$. We develop new techniques to
track stabilizer-groups based on normal forms for group automorphisms and
quadratic functions. We use our normal forms to reduce the problem of
simulating normalizer circuits to that of finding general solutions of systems
of mixed real-integer linear equations [3] and exploit this fact to devise a
robust simulation algorithm: the latter remains efficient even in pathological
cases where stabilizer groups become infinite, uncountable and non-compact. The
techniques developed in this paper might find applications in the study of
fault-tolerant quantum computation with superconducting qubits [4,5].

	abstract = {Low-loss transmission and sensitive recovery of weak radio-frequency (rf) and microwave signals is an ubiquitous technological challenge, crucial in fields as diverse as radio astronomy, medical imaging, navigation and communication, including those of quantum states. Efficient upconversion of rf-signals to an optical carrier would allow transmitting them via optical fibers dramatically reducing losses, and give access to the mature toolbox of quantum optical techniques, routinely enabling quantum-limited signal detection. Research in the field of cavity optomechanics has shown that nanomechanical oscillators can couple very strongly to either microwave or optical fields. An oscillator accommodating both functionalities would bear great promise as the intermediate platform in a radio-to-optical transduction cascade. Here, we demonstrate such an opto-electro-mechanical transducer utilizing a high-Q nanomembrane. A moderate voltage bias (<10V) is sufficient to induce strong coupling between the voltage fluctuations in a rf resonance circuit and the membrane{\textquoteright}s displacement, which is simultaneously coupled to light reflected off its metallized surface. The circuit acts as an antenna; the voltage signals it induces are detected as an optical phase shift with quantum-limited sensitivity. The half-wave voltage is in the microvolt range, orders of magnitude below that of standard optical modulators. The noise added by the membrane is suppressed by the electro-mechanical cooperativity C~6800 and has a temperature of 40mK, far below 300K where the entire device is operated. This corresponds to a sensitivity limit as low as 5 pV/Hz^1/2, or -210dBm/Hz in a narrow band around 1 MHz. Our work introduces an entirely new approach to all-optical, ultralow-noise detection of classical electronic signals, and sets the stage for coherent upconversion of low-frequency quantum signals to the optical domain.

Efficient obfuscators would have many applications in cryptography. Until recently, theoretical progress has mainly been limited to no-go results. Recent works have proposed the first efficient obfuscation algorithms for classical logic circuits, based on a notion of indistinguishability against polynomial-time adversaries. In this work, we propose a new notion of obfuscation, which we call partial-indistinguishability. This notion is based on computationally universal groups with efficiently computable normal forms, and appears to be incomparable with existing definitions. We describe universal gate sets for both classical and quantum computation, in which our definition of obfuscation can be met by polynomial-time algorithms. We also discuss some potential applications to testing quantum computers. We stress that the cryptographic security of these obfuscators, especially when composed with translation from other gate sets, remains an open question.</p>},

We demonstrate that these two contributions not only bound but, except at long

standard methods for privacy amplification cannot be applied here, because the
adversary has advance knowledge of the hash function that the honest parties
will use.
  In this paper we show a stronger form of privacy amplification that solves
this problem, using a fixed hash function that is secure against all possible
adversaries in the isolated qubits model. This allows us to construct
single-bit OTM{\textquoteright}s which only leak an exponentially small amount of information.
  We then study a natural generalization of the isolated qubits model, where
the adversary is allowed to perform a polynomially-bounded number of entangling
gates, in addition to unbounded local operations and classical communication
(LOCC). We show that our technique for privacy amplification is also secure in

that the structure of information is not what we thought it was: there are
operational, i.e., phenomenal, probabilistic correlations that lie outside the

classical resources, which generate classical correlations represented by the
points in a simplex, where the vertices of the simplex represent joint
deterministic states that are the common causes of the correlations. The {\textquoteleft}no

outside the local polytope into a classical simplex by supposing that something
has been left out of the story. The replacement of the classical simplex by the
quantum convex set as the structure representing probabilistic correlations is
the analogue for quantum mechanics of the replacement of Newton{\textquoteright}s Euclidean
space and time by Minkowski spacetime in special relativity. The nonclassical
features of quantum mechanics, including the irreducible information loss on
measurement, are generic features of correlations that lie outside the local
correlation polytope. This paper is an elaboration of these ideas, and its
consequences for the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. A large part of
the difficulty is removed by seeing that the inconsistency in reconciling the
entangled state at the end of a quantum measurement process with the
definiteness of the macroscopic pointer reading and the definiteness of the
correlated value of the measured micro-observable is only apparent and depends
on a stipulation that is not required by the structure of the quantum

	abstract = {  There is now a significant body of results on quantum interactions with
closed timelike curves (CTCs) in the quantum information literature, for both
the Deutsch model of CTC interactions (D-CTCs) and the projective model
(P-CTCs). As a consequence, there is a prima facie argument exploiting
entanglement that CTC interactions would enable superluminal and, indeed,
effectively instantaneous signaling. In cases of spacelike separation between
the sender of a signal and the receiver, whether a receiver measures the local
part of an entangled state or a disentangled state to access the signal can
depend on the reference frame. We propose a consistency condition that gives
priority to either an entangled perspective or a disentangled perspective in
spacelike separated scenarios. For D-CTC interactions, the consistency
condition gives priority to frames of reference in which the state is
disentangled, while for P-CTC interactions the condition selects the entangled
state. Using the consistency condition, we show that there is a procedure that
allows Alice to signal to Bob in the past via relayed superluminal
communications between spacelike separated Alice and Clio, and spacelike
separated Clio and Bob. This opens the door to time travel paradoxes in the
classical domain. Ralph (arXiv:1107.4675) first pointed this out for P-CTCs,
but we show that Ralph{\textquoteright}s procedure for a {\textquoteright}radio to the past{\textquoteright} is flawed. Since
both D-CTCs and P-CTCs allow classical information to be sent around a
spacetime loop, it follows from a result by Aaronson and Watrous
(Proc.Roy.Soc.A, 465:631-647 (2009)) for CTC-enhanced classical computation
that a quantum computer with access to P-CTCs would have the power of PSPACE,
equivalent to a D-CTC-enhanced quantum computer.

the hydrogen-like excited states of group-V donors in silicon. First, we show
how to use plasmon-enhanced light-matter interactions to achieve single-shot
spin readout of the donor qubits via optical excitation and electrical
detection of the emitted plasmons. We then show how plasmons in high mobility
graphene nanoribbons can be used to achieve high-fidelity, two-qubit gates and
entanglement of distant Si donor qubits. The proposed device is readily
compatible with existing technology and fabrication methods.

efficiently implementable.

that the loss suppression is a consequence of the combined effects of lattice
confinement and the continuous quantum Zeno effect. A key finding, relevant for
generic strongly reactive systems, is that while a single-band theory can
qualitatively describe the data, a quantitative analysis must include multiband
effects. Accounting for these effects reduces the inferred molecule filling
fraction by a factor of five. A rate equation can describe much of the data,
but to properly reproduce the loss dynamics with a fixed filling fraction for
all lattice parameters we develop a mean-field model and benchmark it with
numerically exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group

property of symmetric extendibility of underlying bipartite states $\rho_{AB}$
plays an important role. A bipartite state $\rho_{AB}$ is symmetric extendible
if there exits a tripartite state $\rho_{ABB{\textquoteright}}$, such that the $AB$ marginal
state is identical to the $AB{\textquoteright}$ marginal state, i.e. $\rho_{AB{\textquoteright}}=\rho_{AB}$.
For a symmetric extendible state $\rho_{AB}$, the first task of the public
discussion protocol is to break this symmetric extendibility. Therefore to
characterize all bi-partite quantum states that possess symmetric extensions is
of vital importance. We prove a simple analytical formula that a two-qubit
state $\rho_{AB}$ admits a symmetric extension if and only if
$\tr(\rho_B^2)\geq \tr(\rho_{AB}^2)-4\sqrt{\det{\rho_{AB}}}$. Given the
intimate relationship between the symmetric extension problem and the quantum

Instead, we propose a new model based on "isolated qubits" -- qubits that can

This model combines a quantum resource (single-qubit measurements) with a
classical restriction (on communication between qubits), and can be implemented

this model, we construct OTM{\textquoteright}s that are information-theoretically secure

  Our construction resembles Wiesner{\textquoteright}s old idea of quantum conjugate coding,
implemented using random error-correcting codes; our proof of security uses
entropy chaining to bound the supremum of a suitable empirical process. In
addition, we conjecture that our random codes can be replaced by some class of
efficiently-decodable codes, to get computationally-efficient OTM{\textquoteright}s that are
secure against computationally-bounded LOCC adversaries.
  In addition, we construct data-hiding states, which allow an LOCC sender to
encode an (n-O(1))-bit messsage into n qubits, such that at most half of the

A generalized Gross-Pitaveskii equation is derived for a small BEC moving

a Thomas-Fermi density distribution. For a medium and laser of the same

Thomas-Fermi radius of the medium. For typical narrow Feshbach resonances and a

in generating entangled states for use in quantum metrology and quantum
information. In particular, ultracold atomic gases, trapped ion systems, and
Rydberg atoms realize long-ranged Ising models, which even in the absence of a
transverse field can give rise to highly non-classical dynamics and long-range
quantum correlations. In the first part of this paper, we present a detailed
theoretical framework for studying the dynamics of such systems driven (at time
t=0) into arbitrary unentangled non-equilibrium states, thus greatly extending
and unifying the work of Ref. [1]. Specifically, we derive exact expressions
for closed-time-path ordered correlation functions, and use these to study
experimentally relevant observables, e.g. Bloch vector and spin-squeezing
dynamics. In the second part, these correlation functions are then used to
derive closed-form expressions for the dynamics of arbitrary spin-spin
correlation functions in the presence of both T_1 (spontaneous spin
relaxation/excitation) and T_2 (dephasing) type decoherence processes. Even
though the decoherence is local, our solution reveals that the competition
between Ising dynamics and T_1 decoherence gives rise to an emergent non-local
dephasing effect, thereby drastically amplifying the degradation of quantum
correlations. In addition to identifying the mechanism of this deleterious
effect, our solution points toward a scheme to eliminate it via
measurement-based coherent feedback.

In a decision-tree model, the cost of an algorithm is measured by the number of edges in the graph that it queries. R. Karp conjectured in the early 1970s that all monotone graph properties are evasive -- that is, any algorithm which computes a monotone graph property must check all edges in the worst case. This conjecture is unproven, but a lot of progress has been made. Starting with the work of Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant in 1984, topological methods have been applied to prove partial results on the Karp conjecture. This text is a tutorial on these topological methods. I give a fully self-contained account of the central proofs from the paper of Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant, with no prior knowledge of topology assumed. I also briefly survey some of the more recent results on evasiveness.</span></p>},

	abstract = {  We study the formation and collision-aided decay of an ultra-cold atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate in the first excited band of a double-well 2D-optical
lattice with weak harmonic confinement in the perpendicular $z$ direction. This
lattice geometry is based on an experiment by Wirth et al. The double well is
asymmetric, with the local ground state in the shallow well nearly degenerate
with the first excited state of the adjacent deep well. We compare the band
structure obtained from a tight-binding (TB) model with that obtained
numerically using a plane wave basis. We find the TB model to be in
quantitative agreement for the lowest two bands, qualitative for next two
bands, and inadequate for even higher bands. The band widths of the excited
bands are much larger than the harmonic oscillator energy spacing in the $z$
direction. We then study the thermodynamics of a non-interacting Bose gas in
the first excited band. We estimate the condensate fraction and critical
temperature, $T_c$, as functions of lattice parameters. For typical atom
numbers, the critical energy $k_BT_c$, with $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant, is
larger than the excited band widths and harmonic oscillator energy. Using
conservation of total energy and atom number, we show that the temperature
increases after the lattice transformation. Finally, we estimate the time scale
for a two-body collision-aided decay of the condensate as a function of lattice
parameters. The decay involves two processes, the dominant one in which both
colliding atoms decay to the ground band, and the second involving excitation
of one atom to a higher band. For this estimate, we have used TB wave functions
for the lowest four bands, and numerical estimates for higher bands. The decay
rate rapidly increases with lattice depth, but stays smaller than the tunneling
rate between the $s$ and $p$ orbitals in adjacent wells.

Many have considered the possibility that, at long distances or large mass scales, this process changes in some way to lead to classical behavior. Here we hypothesize that classical behavior could be due to an inability of some force carriers to convey entanglement, a characteristic measure of nonlocal, quantum behavior. We then prove that there exists a local test that allows one to verify entanglement generation, falsifying our hypothesis. Crucially, we show that noise measurements can directly verify entanglement generation. This provides a step forward for a wide variety of experimental systems where traditional entanglement tests are challenging, including entanglement generation by gravity alone between macroscopic torsional oscillators.

across the dots, the saturation of the nuclear polarization process associated
with formation of so-called "dark states," and the elimination of the
difference field. In particular, when the dots are different sizes we found
that the Overhauser field becomes larger in the smaller dot. Here we present a
detailed theoretical analysis of these problems including a model of the
polarization dynamics and the development of a new numerical method to
efficiently simulate semiclassical central-spin problems. When nuclear spin
noise is included, the results agree with our prior work indicating that large
difference fields and dark states are stable configurations, while the
elimination of the difference field is unstable; however, in the absence of

	abstract = {  We develop an interferometric technique for making time-resolved measurements
of field-quadrature operators for nonequilibrium ultracold bosons in optical
lattices. The technique exploits the internal state structure of magnetic atoms
to create two subsystems of atoms in different spin states and lattice sites. A
Feshbach resonance turns off atom-atom interactions in one spin subsystem,
making it a well-characterized reference state, while atoms in the other
subsystem undergo nonequilibrium dynamics for a variable hold time. Interfering
the subsystems via a second beam-splitting operation, time-resolved quadrature
measurements on the interacting atoms are obtained by detecting relative spin
populations. The technique can provide quadrature measurements for a variety of
Hamiltonians and lattice geometries (e.g., cubic, honeycomb, superlattices),
including systems with tunneling, spin-orbit couplings using artificial gauge
fields, and higher-band effects. Analyzing the special case of a deep lattice
with negligible tunneling, we obtain the time evolution of both quadrature
observables and their fluctuations. As a second application, we show that the
interferometer can be used to measure atom-atom interaction strengths with
super-Heisenberg scaling n^(-3/2) in the mean number of atoms per lattice site
n, and standard quantum limit scaling M^(-1/2) in the number of lattice sites
M. In our analysis, we require M >> 1 and for realistic systems n is small, and
therefore the scaling in total atom number N = nM is below the Heisenberg
limit; nevertheless, measurements testing the scaling behaviors for
interaction-based quantum metrologies should be possible in this system.

the various ground state spin configurations are separated by multiple
first-order phase transitions, which in our zero temperature system cannot be
driven by thermal fluctuations. We instead use a transverse magnetic field as a
quantum catalyst to observe the first steps of the complete fractal devil{\textquoteright}s
staircase, which emerges in the thermodynamic limit and can be mapped to a
large number of many-body and energy-optimization problems.

	abstract = {  We analyze two approaches to quantum state transfer in solid-state spin
systems. First, we consider unpolarized spin-chains and extend previous
analysis to various experimentally relevant imperfections, including quenched
disorder, dynamical decoherence, and uncompensated long range coupling. In
finite-length chains, the interplay between disorder-induced localization and
decoherence yields a natural optimal channel fidelity, which we calculate.
Long-range dipolar couplings induce a finite intrinsic lifetime for the
mediating eigenmode; extensive numerical simulations of dipolar chains of
lengths up to L=12 show remarkably high fidelity despite these decay processes.
We further consider the extension of the protocol to bosonic systems of coupled
oscillators. Second, we introduce a quantum mirror based architecture for
universal quantum computing which exploits all of the spins in the system as
potential qubits. While this dramatically increases the number of qubits
available, the composite operations required to manipulate "dark" spin qubits
significantly raise the error threshold for robust operation. Finally, as an
example, we demonstrate that eigenmode-mediated state transfer can enable
robust long-range logic between spatially separated Nitrogen-Vacancy registers
in diamond; numerical simulations confirm that high fidelity gates are
achievable even in the presence of moderate disorder.

Using a discrete solitary mode of uncoupled spin components as an initial
condition, the time evolution of this many-body system is found to be
characterized by two dominant frequencies leading to quasiperiodic dynamics at
various sites. The dynamics of spatially-averaged and spin-averaged degrees of
freedom, however, is periodic enabling an unique identification of the two
frequencies. By increasing the spin-dependent atom-atom interaction strength we
observe a resonance state, where the ratio of the two frequencies is a
characteristic integer multiple and the spin-and-spatial degrees of freedom
oscillate in "unison". Crucially, this resonant state is found to signal the
onset to chaotic dynamics characterized by a broad band spectrum. In a
ferromagnetic spinor condensate with attractive spin-dependent interactions,
the resonance is accompanied by a transition from oscillatory- to
rotational-type dynamics as the time evolution of the relative phase of the
matter wave of the individual spin projections changes from bounded to
unbounded.

for constructing quantum error-correcting codes known to date. A CWS code Q can
be represented by a self-dual additive code S and a classical code C, i.,e.,
Q=(S,C), however this representation is in general not unique. We show that for
any CWS code Q with certain permutation symmetry, one can always find a
self-dual additive code S with the same permutation symmetry as Q such that
Q=(S,C). As many good CWS codes have been found by starting from a chosen S,
this ensures that when trying to find CWS codes with certain permutation
symmetry, the choice of S with the same symmetry will suffice. A key step for
this result is a new canonical representation for CWS codes, which is given in
terms of a unique decomposition as union stabilizer codes. For CWS codes, so
far mainly the standard form (G,C) has been considered, where G is a graph
state. We analyze the symmetry of the corresponding graph of G, which in
general cannot possess the same permutation symmetry as Q. We show that it is
indeed the case for the toric code on a square lattice with translational
symmetry, even if its encoding graph can be chosen to be translational
invariant.

different types of uniqueness: (1) no other pure state is compatible with the

with the same measurement results. For case (1), it is known that for a
d-dimensional Hilbert space, there exists a set of 4d-5 observables that
uniquely determines any pure state. We show that for case (2), 5d-7 observables
suffice to uniquely determine any pure state. Thus there is a gap between the

of observables corresponding to reduced density matrices (RDMs) of a
multipartite system is also discussed, where we improve known bounds on local
dimensions for case (2) in which almost all pure states are uniquely determined
by their RDMs. We further discuss circumstances where (1) can imply (2). We use
convexity of the numerical range of operators to show that when only two
observables are measured, (1) always implies (2). More generally, if there is a
compact group of symmetries of the state space which has the span of the
observables measured as the set of fixed points, then (1) implies (2). We
analyze the possible dimensions for the span of such observables. Our results
extend naturally to the case of low rank quantum states.

	abstract = {  A universal entangler (UE) is a unitary operation which maps all pure product
states to entangled states. It is known that for a bipartite system of
particles $1,2$ with a Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d_2}$,
a UE exists when $\min{(d_1,d_2)}\geq 3$ and $(d_1,d_2)\neq (3,3)$. It is also
known that whenever a UE exists, almost all unitaries are UEs; however to
verify whether a given unitary is a UE is very difficult since solving a
quadratic system of equations is NP-hard in general. This work examines the
existence and construction of UEs of bipartite bosonic/fermionic systems whose
wave functions sit in the symmetric/antisymmetric subspace of
$\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$. The development of a theory of UEs for
these types of systems needs considerably different approaches from that used
for UEs of distinguishable systems. This is because the general entanglement of
identical particle systems cannot be discussed in the usual way due to the
effect of (anti)-symmetrization which introduces "pseudo entanglement" that is
inaccessible in practice. We show that, unlike the distinguishable particle
case, UEs exist for bosonic/fermionic systems with Hilbert spaces which are
symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) subspaces of
$\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$ if and only if $d\geq 3$ (resp. $d\geq
8$). To prove this we employ algebraic geometry to reason about the different
algebraic structures of the bosonic/fermionic systems. Additionally, due to the
relatively simple coherent state form of unentangled bosonic states, we are
able to give the explicit constructions of two bosonic UEs. Our investigation
provides insight into the entanglement properties of systems of
indisitinguishable particles, and in particular underscores the difference
between the entanglement structures of bosonic, fermionic and distinguishable
particle systems.

	abstract = {The hybrid argument allows one to relate the distinguishability of a distribution (from uniform)
to the predictability of individual bits given a prefix. The argument incurs a loss of a factor
k equal to the bit-length of the distributions: -distinguishability implies only /k-predictability.
This paper studies the consequences of avoiding this loss {\textendash} what we call {\textquotedblleft}beating the hybrid argument{\textquotedblright}
{\textendash} and develops new proof techniques that circumvent the loss in certain natural settings.
Specifically, we obtain the following results:
1. We give an instantiation of the Nisan-Wigderson generator (JCSS {\textquoteright}94) that can be broken
by quantum computers, and that is o(1)-unpredictable against AC0
. This is not enough
to imply indistinguishability via the hybrid argument because of the hybrid-argument
loss; nevertheless, we conjecture that this generator indeed fools AC0
, and we prove this
statement for a simplified version of the problem. Our conjecture implies the existence of
an oracle relative to which BQP is not in the PH, a longstanding open problem.
2. We show that the {\textquotedblleft}INW{\textquotedblright} generator by Impagliazzo, Nisan, and Wigderson (STOC {\textquoteright}94)
with seed length O(log n log log n) produces a distribution that is 1/ log n-unpredictable
against poly-logarithmic width (general) read-once oblivious branching programs. Thus
avoiding the hybrid-argument loss would lead to a breakthrough in generators against
small space.
3. We study pseudorandom generators obtained from a hard function by repeated sampling.
We identify a property of functions, {\textquotedblleft}resamplability,{\textquotedblright} that allows us to beat the hybrid argument,
leading to new pseudorandom generators for AC0
[p] and similar classes. Although
the generators have sub-linear stretch, they represent the best-known generators for these
classes.
Thus we establish that {\textquotedblleft}beating{\textquotedblright} or bypassing the hybrid argument would have two significant
consequences in complexity, and we take steps toward that goal by developing techniques that
indeed beat the hybrid argument in related (but simpler) settings, leading to best-known PRGs
for certain complexity classes.

	abstract = {  Physical properties of the ground and excited states of a $k$-local
Hamiltonian are largely determined by the $k$-particle reduced density matrices
($k$-RDMs), or simply the $k$-matrix for fermionic systems---they are at least
enough for the calculation of the ground state and excited state energies.
Moreover, for a non-degenerate ground state of a $k$-local Hamiltonian, even
the state itself is completely determined by its $k$-RDMs, and therefore
contains no genuine ${>}k$-particle correlations, as they can be inferred from
$k$-particle correlation functions. It is natural to ask whether a similar
result holds for non-degenerate excited states. In fact, for fermionic systems,
it has been conjectured that any non-degenerate excited state of a 2-local
Hamiltonian is simultaneously a unique ground state of another 2-local
Hamiltonian, hence is uniquely determined by its 2-matrix. And a weaker version
of this conjecture states that any non-degenerate excited state of a 2-local
Hamiltonian is uniquely determined by its 2-matrix among all the pure
$n$-particle states. We construct explicit counterexamples to show that both
conjectures are false. It means that correlations in excited states of local
Hamiltonians could be dramatically different from those in ground states. We
further show that any non-degenerate excited state of a $k$-local Hamiltonian
is a unique ground state of another $2k$-local Hamiltonian, hence is uniquely
determined by its $2k$-RDMs (or $2k$-matrix).

In general such systems do not necessarily relax to a Boltzmann distribution if the coupling to the thermal reservoir is non-vanishing or equivalently if the relaxation timescales are finite. Using a variety of non-equilibrium formalisms valid for non-Markovian processes, we show that starting from a product state of the closed system = system + environment, with the environment in its thermal state, the open system which results from coarse graining the environment will evolve towards an equilibrium state at late-times. This state can be expressed as the reduced state of the closed system thermal state at the temperature of the environment. For a linear (harmonic) system and environment, which is exactly solvable, we are able to show in a rigorous way that all multi-time correlations of the open system evolve towards those of the closed system thermal state. Multi-time correlations are especially relevant in the non-Markovian regime, since they cannot be generated by the dynamics of the single-time correlations. For more general systems, which cannot be exactly solved, we are able to provide a general proof that all single-time correlations of the open system evolve to those of the closed system thermal state, to first order in the relaxation rates. For the special case of a zero-temperature reservoir, we are able to explicitly construct the reduced closed system thermal state in terms of the environmental correlations.

while quantum information science asks for the existence and construction of
certain Hamiltonians for given ground states. In practical situations, one
would be mainly interested in local Hamiltonians with certain interaction
patterns, such as nearest neighbour interactions on some type of lattices. A
necessary condition for a space $V$ to be the ground-state space of some local
Hamiltonian with a given interaction pattern, is that the maximally mixed state
supported on $V$ is uniquely determined by its reduced density matrices
associated with the given pattern, based on the principle of maximum entropy.
However, it is unclear whether this condition is in general also sufficient. We
examine the situations for the existence of such a local Hamiltonian to have
$V$ satisfying the necessary condition mentioned above as its ground-state
space, by linking to faces of the convex body of the local reduced states. We
further discuss some methods for constructing the corresponding local
Hamiltonians with given interaction patterns, mainly from physical points of

frustration-free Hamiltonians, as well as thermodynamical ensembles.

inputs are restricted to be product states. In this paper, we mainly focus on
the {\textquoteright}weakest{\textquoteright} one, i.e., the minimum entangling power, among all these
entangling powers. We show that, by choosing von Neumann entropy of reduced
density operator or Schmidt rank as entanglement measure, even the {\textquoteright}weakest{\textquoteright}
entangling power is generically very close to its maximal possible entanglement
generation. In other words, maximum, average and minimum entangling powers are
generically close. We then study minimum entangling power with respect to other
Lipschitiz-continuous entanglement measures and generalize our results to
multipartite quantum systems.
  As a straightforward application, a random quantum gate will almost surely be
an intrinsically fault-tolerant entangling device that will always transform
every low-entangled state to near-maximally entangled state.

black-box input bits is Theta(sqrt(n)). However, the corresponding problem for
read-many formulas (i.e., formulas in which the inputs have fanout) is not well
understood. Although the optimal read-once formula evaluation algorithm can be
applied to any formula, it can be suboptimal if the inputs have large fanout.
We give an algorithm for evaluating any formula with n inputs, size S, and G
gates using O(min{n, sqrt{S}, n^{1/2} G^{1/4}}) quantum queries. Furthermore,
we show that this algorithm is optimal, since for any n,S,G there exists a
formula with n inputs, size at most S, and at most G gates that requires
Omega(min{n, sqrt{S}, n^{1/2} G^{1/4}}) queries. We also show that the
algorithm remains nearly optimal for circuits of any particular depth k >= 3,
and we give a linear-size circuit of depth 2 that requires Omega (n^{5/9})
queries. Applications of these results include a Omega (n^{19/18}) lower bound
for Boolean matrix product verification, a nearly tight characterization of the
quantum query complexity of evaluating constant-depth circuits with bounded
fanout, new formula gate count lower bounds for several functions including
PARITY, and a construction of an AC^0 circuit of linear size that can only be
evaluated by a formula with Omega(n^{2-epsilon}) gates.

	abstract = {  Intuitively, if a density operator has small rank, then it should be easier
to estimate from experimental data, since in this case only a few eigenvectors
need to be learned. We prove two complementary results that confirm this
intuition. First, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using
fewer copies of the state, i.e., the sample complexity of tomography decreases
with the rank. Second, we show that unknown low-rank states can be
reconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from
compressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli
measurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions
about the unknown state.
  We give a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the
restricted isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we
obtain near-optimal error bounds, for the realistic situation where the data
contains noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank
with decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper-bounds on the sample complexity
of compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample
complexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements.
  Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed
sensing estimators with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find
that, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing
estimators consistently produce higher-fidelity state reconstructions than MLE.
In addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster
classical processing with no loss of accuracy.
  Finally, we show how to certify the accuracy of a low rank estimate using
direct fidelity estimation and we describe a method for compressed quantum
process tomography that works for processes with small Kraus rank.

the past decade as one of the central challenges at the interface of
fundamental science and engineering. Much progress has been made towards this
goal. Indeed, quantum operations have been demonstrated on several trapped ion
qubits, and other solid-state systems are approaching similar levels of
control. Extending these techniques to achieve fault-tolerant operations in
larger systems with more qubits remains an extremely challenging goal, in part,
due to the substantial technical complexity of current implementations. Here,
we propose and analyze an architecture for a scalable, solid-state quantum
information processor capable of operating at or near room temperature. The
architecture is applicable to realistic conditions, which include disorder and
relevant decoherence mechanisms, and includes a hierarchy of control at
successive length scales. Our approach is based upon recent experimental
advances involving Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers in diamond and will provide
fundamental insights into the physics of non-equilibrium many-body quantum
systems. Additionally, the proposed architecture may greatly alleviate the
stringent constraints, currently limiting the realization of scalable quantum
processors.

	month = {2012/04/30},
	pages = {193-214},
	abstract = {  The problem of topic modeling can be seen as a generalization of the
clustering problem, in that it posits that observations are generated due to
multiple latent factors (e.g., the words in each document are generated as a
mixture of several active topics, as opposed to just one). This increased
representational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervised
learning problem of estimating the topic probability vectors (the distributions
over words for each topic), when only the words are observed and the
corresponding topics are hidden.
  We provide a simple and efficient learning procedure that is guaranteed to
recover the parameters for a wide class of mixture models, including the
popular latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. For LDA, the procedure
correctly recovers both the topic probability vectors and the prior over the
topics, using only trigram statistics (i.e., third order moments, which may be
estimated with documents containing just three words). The method, termed
Excess Correlation Analysis (ECA), is based on a spectral decomposition of low
order moments (third and fourth order) via two singular value decompositions
(SVDs). Moreover, the algorithm is scalable since the SVD operations are
carried out on $k\times k$ matrices, where $k$ is the number of latent factors
(e.g. the number of topics), rather than in the $d$-dimensional observed space
(typically $d \gg k$).

continuous-variable states. As a technical result, this work generalizes
quantum compressed sensing to the situation where the measured observables are

covering most realistic measurement scenarios. As an application, we discuss
the reconstruction of quantum states of light from homodyne detection and other
types of measurements, and we present simulations that show the advantage of
the proposed compressed sensing technique over present methods. Finally, we
introduce a method to construct a certificate which guarantees the success of
the reconstruction with no assumption on the state, and we show how slightly

},

	year = {2011},
	month = {2011/5/9},
	abstract = {  One-way quantum computing achieves the full power of quantum computation by
performing single particle measurements on some many-body entangled state,
known as the resource state. As single particle measurements are relatively
easy to implement, the preparation of the resource state becomes a crucial
task. An appealing approach is simply to cool a strongly correlated quantum
many-body system to its ground state. In addition to requiring the ground state
of the system to be universal for one-way quantum computing, we also want the
Hamiltonian to have non-degenerate ground state protected by a fixed energy
gap, to involve only two-body interactions, and to be frustration-free so that
measurements in the course of the computation leave the remaining particles in
the ground space. Recently, significant efforts have been made to the search of
resource states that appear naturally as ground states in spin lattice systems.
The approach is proved to be successful in spin-5/2 and spin-3/2 systems. Yet,
it remains an open question whether there could be such a natural resource
state in a spin-1/2, i.e., qubit system. Here, we give a negative answer to
this question by proving that it is impossible for a genuinely entangled qubit
states to be a non-degenerate ground state of any two-body frustration-free
Hamiltonian. What is more, we prove that every spin-1/2 frustration-free
Hamiltonian with two-body interaction always has a ground state that is a
product of single- or two-qubit states, a stronger result that is interesting
independent of the context of one-way quantum computing.

Furthermore, an analytic treatment of Gutzwiller mean-field theory reveals that
quantum spin fluctuations induced by the Kondo exchange cause the otherwise
continuous superfluid to Mott-insulator phase transition to be first order. We
show that lattice separability imposes a serious constraint on proposals to
exploit excited bands for quantum simulations, and discuss a way to overcome
this constraint in the context of our model by using an experimentally realized
non-separable lattice. A method to probe the first-order nature of the
transition based on collapses and revivals of the matter-wave field is also

	abstract = {  Motivated by ongoing measurements at JILA, we calculate the recoil-free
spectra of dipolar interacting fermions, for example ultracold heteronuclear
molecules, in a one-dimensional lattice of two-dimensional pancakes,
spectroscopically probing transitions between different internal (e.g.,
rotational) states. We additionally incorporate p-wave interactions and losses,
which are important for reactive molecules such as KRb. Moreover, we consider
other sources of spectral broadening: interaction-induced quasiparticle
lifetimes and the different polarizabilities of the different rotational states
used for the spectroscopy. Although our main focus is molecules, some of the
calculations are also useful for optical lattice atomic clocks. For example,
understanding the p-wave shifts between identical fermions and small dipolar
interactions coming from the excited clock state are necessary to reach future
precision goals. Finally, we consider the spectra in a deep 3D lattice and show
how they give a great deal of information about static correlation functions,
including \textit{all} the moments of the density correlations between nearby
sites. The range of correlations measurable depends on spectroscopic resolution
and the dipole moment.

such that access to even a single copy of both channels allows classical

Incomplete relaxation terminating in "dark states" can occur, from which the
only escape is through individual spontaneous emission on a much longer time
scale. The relaxation dynamics can be significantly accelerated or retarded,
depending on the distribution of the coupling constants. On the technical side,
we also generalize the previously known propagator of superradiance for
identical couplings in the completely symmetric sector to the full
exponentially large Hilbert space.

which we refer to as the t-J-V-W model. In addition to XXZ spin exchange, the
model features density-density interactions and novel density-spin
interactions; all interactions are dipolar. We show that full control of all
interaction parameters in both magnitude and sign can be achieved independently
of each other and of the tunneling. As a first step towards demonstrating the
potential of the system, we apply the density matrix renormalization group
method (DMRG) to obtain the 1D phase diagram of the simplest experimentally
realizable case. Specifically, we show that the tunability and the long-range
nature of the interactions in the t-J-V-W model enable enhanced superfluidity.
Finally, we show that Bloch oscillations in a tilted lattice can be used to
probe the phase diagram experimentally.

Fourier coefficients.
  We show that almost all sets of O(rd log^6 d) Pauli measurements satisfy the
rank-r restricted isometry property (RIP). This implies that M can be recovered
from a fixed ("universal") set of Pauli measurements, using nuclear-norm
minimization (e.g., the matrix Lasso), with nearly-optimal bounds on the error.
A similar result holds for any class of measurements that use an orthonormal
operator basis whose elements have small operator norm. Our proof uses Dudley{\textquoteright}s
inequality for Gaussian processes, together with bounds on covering numbers
obtained via entropy duality.

qubits. We say H is n-universal if it can be used to approximate any unitary
operation on n qubits. While it is well known that almost any 2-qubit
Hamiltonian is 2-universal (Deutsch, Barenco, Ekert 1995; Lloyd 1995), an
explicit characterization of the set of non-universal 2-qubit Hamiltonians has
been elusive. Our main result is a complete characterization of 2-non-universal
2-qubit Hamiltonians. In particular, there are three ways that a 2-qubit
Hamiltonian H can fail to be universal: (1) H shares an eigenvector with the
gate that swaps two qubits, (2) H acts on the two qubits independently (in any
of a certain family of bases), or (3) H has zero trace. A 2-non-universal
2-qubit Hamiltonian can still be n-universal for some n >= 3. We give some
partial results on 3-universality. Finally, we also show how our
characterization of 2-universal Hamiltonians implies the well-known result that
almost any 2-qubit unitary is universal.

control of scattering properties can be achieved by using rf to couple a
colliding pair of atoms to a bound state. We show, using the example of 6Li,
that in some ranges of rf frequency and magnetic field this can be done without
giving rise to losses. We also show that halo molecules of large spatial extent
require much less rf power than deeply bound states. Another way to exert
resonant control is with a set of rf-coupled bound states, linked to the
colliding pair through the molecular interactions that give rise to
magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances. This was recently demonstrated for
87Rb [Kaufman et al., Phys. Rev. A 80:050701(R), 2009]. We examine the
underlying atomic and molecular physics which made this possible. Lastly, we
consider the control that may be exerted over atomic collisions by placing
atoms in superpositions of Zeeman states, and suggest that it could be useful
where small changes in scattering length are required. We suggest other species
for which rf and magnetic field control could together provide a useful tuning
mechanism.

We show that in the case of unequal dots, build up of difference fields generally accompanies the nuclear polarization process, whereas for nearly identical dots, build up of difference fields competes with polarization saturation in dark states. The elimination of the difference field does not, in general, correspond to a stable steady state of the polarization process.

exponentially faster than standard tomography, and it can also be used to
certify that the unknown state is an MPS. The basic idea is to use local
unitary operations to measure in the Schmidt basis, giving direct access to the
MPS representation. This compares favorably with recently and independently
proposed methods that recover the MPS tensors by performing a variational
minimization, which is computationally intractable in certain cases. Our method
also has the advantage of recovering any MPS, while other approaches were
limited to special classes of states that exclude important examples such as

quantum devices. It has been realized in systems with few components, but for
larger systems it becomes infeasible because the number of quantum measurements
and the amount of computation required to process them grows exponentially in
the system size. Here we show that we can do exponentially better than direct
state tomography for a wide range of quantum states, in particular those that
are well approximated by a matrix product state ansatz. We present two schemes
for tomography in 1-D quantum systems and touch on generalizations. One scheme
requires unitary operations on a constant number of subsystems, while the other
requires only local measurements together with more elaborate post-processing.
Both schemes rely only on a linear number of experimental operations and
classical postprocessing that is polynomial in the system size. A further
strength of the methods is that the accuracy of the reconstructed states can be
rigorously certified without any a priori assumptions.

candidates for achieving scalable distribution of entanglement over long

their implementation. However, the entanglement rates and scalability of
current approaches are limited by relatively low retrieval and single-photon
detector efficiencies. We propose a scheme, which makes use of fluorescent
detection of stored excitations to significantly increase the efficiency of

of a two-dimensional gas of ultracold alklaline-earth metal atoms governed by
the Kondo Lattice Hamiltonian plus a parabolic confining potential. In a
homogenous system this mean-field theory is believed to give a qualitatively
correct description of heavy fermion metals and Kondo insulators: it reproduces
the Kondo-like scaling of the quasiparticle mass in the former, and the same
scaling of the excitation gap in the latter. In order to understand
ground-state properties in a trap we extend this mean-field theory via
local-density approximation. We find that the Kondo insulator gap manifests as
a shell structure in the trapped density profile. In addition, a strong
signature of the large Fermi surface expected for heavy fermion systems
survives the confinement, and could be probed in time-of-flight experiments.
From a full self-consistent diagonalization of the mean-field theory we are
able to study dynamics in the trap. We find that the mass enhancement of
quasiparticle excitations in the heavy Fermi liquid phase manifests as slowing
of the dipole oscillations that result from a sudden displacement of the trap
center.

our lower bound result can be extended to the case of arbitrary two quantum

	month = {2010/07/02},
	abstract = {  It is a longstanding open problem to devise an oracle relative to which BQP
does not lie in the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy (PH). We advance a natural
conjecture about the capacity of the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom generator
[NW94] to fool AC_0, with MAJORITY as its hard function. Our conjecture is
essentially that the loss due to the hybrid argument (which is a component of
the standard proof from [NW94]) can be avoided in this setting. This is a
question that has been asked previously in the pseudorandomness literature
[BSW03]. We then make three main contributions: (1) We show that our conjecture
implies the existence of an oracle relative to which BQP is not in the PH. This
entails giving an explicit construction of unitary matrices, realizable by
small quantum circuits, whose row-supports are "nearly-disjoint." (2) We give a
simple framework (generalizing the setting of Aaronson [A10]) in which any
efficiently quantumly computable unitary gives rise to a distribution that can
be distinguished from the uniform distribution by an efficient quantum
algorithm. When applied to the unitaries we construct, this framework yields a
problem that can be solved quantumly, and which forms the basis for the desired
oracle. (3) We prove that Aaronson{\textquoteright}s "GLN conjecture" [A10] implies our
conjecture; our conjecture is thus formally easier to prove. The GLN conjecture
was recently proved false for depth greater than 2 [A10a], but it remains open
for depth 2. If true, the depth-2 version of either conjecture would imply an
oracle relative to which BQP is not in AM, which is itself an outstanding open
problem. Taken together, our results have the following interesting
interpretation: they give an instantiation of the Nisan-Wigderson generator
that can be broken by quantum computers, but not by the relevant modes of
classical computation, if our conjecture is true.

two places at the same time, and that two remote particles can be inextricably
and instantaneously linked. These predictions have been the topic of intense
metaphysical debate ever since the theory{\textquoteright}s inception early last century.
However, supreme predictive power combined with direct experimental observation
of some of these unusual phenomena leave little doubt as to its fundamental
correctness. In fact, without quantum mechanics we could not explain the
workings of a laser, nor indeed how a fridge magnet operates. Over the last
several decades quantum information science has emerged to seek answers to the
question: can we gain some advantage by storing, transmitting and processing
information encoded in systems that exhibit these unique quantum properties?
Today it is understood that the answer is yes. Many research groups around the
world are working towards one of the most ambitious goals humankind has ever
embarked upon: a quantum computer that promises to exponentially improve
computational power for particular tasks. A number of physical systems,
spanning much of modern physics, are being developed for this task---ranging
from single particles of light to superconducting circuits---and it is not yet
clear which, if any, will ultimately prove successful. Here we describe the
latest developments for each of the leading approaches and explain what the
major challenges are for the future.

	title = {Quantum probabilities: an information-theoretic interpretation},
	year = {2010},
	month = {2010/05/14},
	abstract = {  This Chapter develops a realist information-theoretic interpretation of the
nonclassical features of quantum probabilities. On this view, what is
fundamental in the transition from classical to quantum physics is the
recognition that \emph{information in the physical sense has new structural
features}, just as the transition from classical to relativistic physics rests
on the recognition that space-time is structurally different than we thought.
Hilbert space, the event space of quantum systems, is interpreted as a
kinematic (i.e., pre-dynamic) framework for an indeterministic physics, in the
sense that the geometric structure of Hilbert space imposes objective
probabilistic or information-theoretic constraints on correlations between
events, just as the geometric structure of Minkowski space in special
relativity imposes spatio-temporal kinematic constraints on events. The
interpretation of quantum probabilities is more subjectivist in spirit than
other discussions in this book (e.g., the chapter by Timpson), insofar as the
quantum state is interpreted as a credence function---a bookkeeping device for
keeping track of probabilities---but it is also objective (or intersubjective),
insofar as the credences specified by the quantum state are understood as
uniquely determined, via Gleason{\textquoteright}s theorem, by objective correlational
constraints on events in the nonclassical quantum event space defined by the
subspace structure of Hilbert space.

standard methods that require d^2 settings. Our methods have several features
that make them amenable to experimental implementation: they require only
simple Pauli measurements, use fast convex optimization, are stable against

acquired data can be used to certify that the state is indeed close to pure, so
no a priori assumptions are needed. We present both theoretical bounds and
numerical simulations.

	abstract = {  Quantum walk is one of the main tools for quantum algorithms. Defined by
analogy to classical random walk, a quantum walk is a time-homogeneous quantum
process on a graph. Both random and quantum walks can be defined either in
continuous or discrete time. But whereas a continuous-time random walk can be
obtained as the limit of a sequence of discrete-time random walks, the two
types of quantum walk appear fundamentally different, owing to the need for
extra degrees of freedom in the discrete-time case.
  In this article, I describe a precise correspondence between continuous- and
discrete-time quantum walks on arbitrary graphs. Using this correspondence, I
show that continuous-time quantum walk can be obtained as an appropriate limit
of discrete-time quantum walks. The correspondence also leads to a new
technique for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics, giving efficient simulations
even in cases where the Hamiltonian is not sparse. The complexity of the
simulation is linear in the total evolution time, an improvement over
simulations based on high-order approximations of the Lie product formula. As
applications, I describe a continuous-time quantum walk algorithm for element
distinctness and show how to optimally simulate continuous-time query
algorithms of a certain form in the conventional quantum query model. Finally,
I discuss limitations of the method for simulating Hamiltonians with negative
matrix elements, and present two problems that motivate attempting to
circumvent these limitations.

reflect the distribution of pre-measurement values of beables, but would have

probabilities are an artefact of a dynamical process that is not in fact a

Our method has complexity linear in both the sparseness D (the maximum number

methods had complexity scaling as D^4 and were superlinear in t. We also
consider the task of implementing an arbitrary unitary operation given a
black-box description of its matrix elements. Whereas standard methods for
performing an explicitly specified N x N unitary operation use O(N^2)
elementary gates, we show that a black-box unitary can be performed with
bounded error using O(N^{2/3} (log log N)^{4/3}) queries to its matrix
elements. In fact, except for pathological cases, it appears that most
unitaries can be performed with only O(sqrt{N}) queries, which is optimal.

mixture with repulsive intra-species interactions, and either repulsive or
attractive inter-species interaction. For a homogeneous system, we find paired-
and counterflow-superfluid phases at different filling and hopping energies. We
also predict parameter regions in which these types of superfluid order coexist
with charge density wave order. We show that the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
theory and TEBD qualitatively agree on the location of the phase boundary to
superfluidity. We then describe how these phases are modified and can be
detected when an additional harmonic trap is present. In particular, we show
how experimentally measurable quantities, such as time-of-flight images and the
structure factor, can be used to distinguish the quantum phases. Finally, we
suggest applying a Feshbach ramp to detect the paired superfluid state, and a
$\pi/2$ pulse followed by Bragg spectroscopy to detect the counterflow

very-weakly bound molecules formed by magnetic field sweeps near a Feshbach
resonance in collisions of ultra-cold $^{40}$K and $^{87}$Rb atoms. Our
analysis include the multi-channel bound-state calculations of the hyperfine
and Zeeman mixed X$^1\Sigma^+$ and a$^3\Sigma^+$ vibrational levels. We find
excellent agreement with the hyperfine structure observed in experimental data.
In addition, we studied the spin-orbit mixing in the intermediate state of the
Raman transition. This allowed us to investigate its effect on the
vibrationally-averaged transition dipole moment to the lowest ro-vibrational
level of the X$^1\Sigma^+$ state. Finally, we obtained an estimate of the
polarizability of the initial and final ro-vibrational states of the Raman
transition near frequencies relevant for optical trapping of the molecules.

exponentially on the magnetic field and linearly on condensate density. This
crossing is confirmed by tracking the energy of the spinor condensate as well
as by Faraday rotation spectroscopy. We also introduce a phenomenological model

	year = {2008},
	month = {2008/09/02},
	abstract = {  The intrinsic idea of superdense coding is to find as many gates as possible
such that they can be perfectly discriminated. In this paper, we consider a new
scheme of discrimination of quantum gates, called ancilla-assisted
discrimination, in which a set of quantum gates on a $d-$dimensional system are
perfectly discriminated with assistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla system.
The main contribution of the present paper is two-fold: (1) The number of
quantum gates that can be discriminated in this scheme is evaluated. We prove
that any $rd+1$ quantum gates cannot be perfectly discriminated with assistance
from the ancilla, and there exist $rd$ quantum gates which can be perfectly
discriminated with assistance from the ancilla. (2) The dimensionality of the
minimal ancilla system is estimated. We prove that there exists a constant
positive number $c$ such that for any $k\leq cr$ quantum gates, if they are
$d$-assisted discriminable, then they are also $r$-assisted discriminable, and
there are $c^{\prime}r\textrm{}(c^{\prime}>c)$ different quantum gates which
can be discriminated with a $d-$dimensional ancilla, but they cannot be
discriminated if the ancilla is reduced to an $r-$dimensional system. Thus, the
order $O(r)$ of the number of quantum gates that can be discriminated with
assistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla is optimal. The results reported in
this paper represent a preliminary step toward understanding the role ancilla
system plays in discrimination of quantum gates as well as the power and limit
of superdense coding.

Hamiltonians consisting only of two-body interactions. These three-body
effective interactions arise from the third order in perturbation theory. Since
their introduction, perturbative gadgets have become a standard tool in the
theory of quantum computation. Here we construct generalized gadgets so that

Born-Oppenheimer approximation, but faster and more efficient as well, for all
reactions with more than about four atoms. This is the case even though the
entire electronic wavefunction is propagated on a grid with appropriately short
timesteps. Although the preparation and measurement of arbitrary states on a
quantum computer is inefficient, here we demonstrate how to prepare states of

we give any evidence that k quantum proofs are more powerful than one? Does
QMA(k)=QMA(2) for k>=2? Can QMA(k) protocols be amplified to exponentially
small error? In this paper, we make progress on all of the above questions.
First, we give a protocol by which a verifier can be convinced that a 3SAT
formula of size n is satisfiable, with constant soundness, given ~O(sqrt(n))
unentangled quantum witnesses with O(log n) qubits each. Our protocol relies on
the existence of very short PCPs. Second, we show that assuming a weak version
of the Additivity Conjecture from quantum information theory, any QMA(2)
protocol can be amplified to exponentially small error, and QMA(k)=QMA(2) for
all k>=2. Third, we prove the nonexistence of "perfect disentanglers" for
simulating multiple Merlins with one.

present necessary background material for a general physics audience and

is complete for the one clean qubit complexity class, and a generalization of
perturbative gadgets which allows k-body interactions to be directly simulated

quantum computation that I learned in the course of my research, and using
these principles I propose directions for future research.

	abstract = {  QMA (Quantum Merlin-Arthur) is the quantum analogue of the class NP. There
are a few QMA-complete problems, most notably the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}Local Hamiltonian{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} problem
introduced by Kitaev. In this dissertation we show some new QMA-complete
problems.
  The first one is {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}Consistency of Local Density Matrices{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}: given several
density matrices describing different (constant-size) subsets of an n-qubit
system, decide whether these are consistent with a single global state. This
problem was first suggested by Aharonov. We show that it is QMA-complete, via
an oracle reduction from Local Hamiltonian. This uses algorithms for convex
optimization with a membership oracle, due to Yudin and Nemirovskii.
  Next we show that two problems from quantum chemistry, {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}Fermionic Local
Hamiltonian{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}N-representability,{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} are QMA-complete. These problems
arise in calculating the ground state energies of molecular systems.
N-representability is a key component in recently developed numerical methods
using the contracted Schrodinger equation. Although these problems have been
studied since the 1960{\textquoteright}s, it is only recently that the theory of quantum
computation has allowed us to properly characterize their complexity.
  Finally, we study some special cases of the Consistency problem, pertaining
to 1-dimensional and {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}stoquastic{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} systems. We also give an alternative proof
of a result due to Jaynes: whenever local density matrices are consistent, they
are consistent with a Gibbs state.

	abstract = {  The goal of the ordered search problem is to find a particular item in an
ordered list of n items. Using the adversary method, Hoyer, Neerbek, and Shi
proved a quantum lower bound for this problem of (1/pi) ln n + Theta(1). Here,
we find the exact value of the best possible quantum adversary lower bound for
a symmetrized version of ordered search (whose query complexity differs from
that of the original problem by at most 1). Thus we show that the best lower
bound for ordered search that can be proved by the adversary method is (1/pi)
ln n + O(1). Furthermore, we show that this remains true for the generalized
adversary method allowing negative weights.

If we believe that nature will permit us to faithfully implement our current model of quantum computation, then these algorithms dramatically contradict the Strong Church-Turing thesis. The e ect is heightened by the fact that these algorithms solve computational problems with long histories of attention by the computational and mathematical communities alike. In this article we discuss the branch of quantum algorithms research arising from attempts to generalize the core quantum algorithmic aspects of Shor\&$\#$39;s algorithms. Roughly, this can be viewed as the problem of generalizing algorithms of Simon [21] and Shor [20], which work over abelian groups, to general nonabelian groups. The article is meant to be self-contained, assuming no knowledge of quantum computing or the representation theory of nite groups. We begin in earnest in Section 2, describing the problem of symmetry nding : given a function f : G \&rarr; S on a group G, this is the problem of determining {g \&isin; G | \&forall;x, f(x) = f(gx)}, the set of symmetries of f . We switch gears in Section 3, giving a short introduction to the circuit model of quantum computation. The connection between these two sections is eventually established in Section 4, where we discuss the representation theory of nite groups and the quantum Fourier transform a unitary transformation speci cally tuned to the symmetries of the underlying group.

underlying ensemble evolves under a classical distribution of unitary
processes. While many incoherent processes appear decoherent, there are
important differences. The distribution functions underlying incoherent
processes are either static or slowly varying with respect to control
operations and so the errors introduced by these distributions are refocusable.
The observation and control of incoherence in small Hilbert spaces is well
known. Here we explore incoherence during an entangling operation, such as is
relevant in quantum information processing. As expected, it is more difficult
to separate incoherence and decoherence over such processes. However, by
studying the fidelity decay under a cyclic entangling map we are able to
identify distinctive experimental signatures of incoherence. This result is
demonstrated both through numerical simulations and experimentally in a three
qubit nuclear magnetic resonance implementation.

	abstract = {  We argue that the intractable part of the measurement problem -- the {\textquoteright}big{\textquoteright}
measurement problem -- is a pseudo-problem that depends for its legitimacy on
the acceptance of two dogmas. The first dogma is John Bell{\textquoteright}s assertion that
measurement should never be introduced as a primitive process in a fundamental
mechanical theory like classical or quantum mechanics, but should always be
open to a complete analysis, in principle, of how the individual outcomes come
about dynamically. The second dogma is the view that the quantum state has an
ontological significance analogous to the significance of the classical state
as the {\textquoteright}truthmaker{\textquoteright} for propositions about the occurrence and non-occurrence of
events, i.e., that the quantum state is a representation of physical reality.
We show how both dogmas can be rejected in a realist information-theoretic
interpretation of quantum mechanics as an alternative to the Everett
interpretation. The Everettian, too, regards the {\textquoteright}big{\textquoteright} measurement problem as a
pseudo-problem, because the Everettian rejects the assumption that measurements
have definite outcomes, in the sense that one particular outcome, as opposed to
other possible outcomes, actually occurs in a quantum measurement process. By
contrast with the Everettians, we accept that measurements have definite
outcomes. By contrast with the Bohmians and the GRW {\textquoteright}collapse{\textquoteright} theorists who
add structure to the theory and propose dynamical solutions to the {\textquoteright}big{\textquoteright}
measurement problem, we take the problem to arise from the failure to see the
significance of Hilbert space as a new kinematic framework for the physics of
an indeterministic universe, in the sense that Hilbert space imposes kinematic
(i.e., pre-dynamic) objective probabilistic constraints on correlations between
events.

Bounded Distance Decoding is a variant of this problem in which the target is guaranteed to be close to the lattice, relative to the minimum distance λ1(L) of the lattice. Specifically, in the α-Bounded Distance Decoding problem (α-BDD), we are given a lattice L and a vector y⃗  (within distance α.λ1(L) from the lattice), and we are asked to find a lattice point x⃗ ∈L within distance α.λ1(L) from the target. In coding theory, the lattice points correspond to codewords, and the target points correspond to lattice points being perturbed by noise vectors. Since in coding theory the lattice is usually fixed, we may {\textquotedblleft}pre-process{\textquotedblright} it before receiving any targets, to make the subsequent decoding faster. This leads us to consider α-BDD with pre-processing. We show how a recent technique of Aharonov and Regev [2] can be used to solve α-BDD with pre-processing in polynomial time for α=O((logn)/n-------√). This improves upon the previously best known algorithm due to Klein [13] which solved the problem for α=O(1/n).

	abstract = {  Suppose we have an n-qubit system, and we are given a collection of local
density matrices rho_1,...,rho_m, where each rho_i describes some subset of the
qubits. We say that rho_1,...,rho_m are "consistent" if there exists a global
state sigma (on all n qubits) whose reduced density matrices match
rho_1,...,rho_m.
  We prove the following result: if rho_1,...,rho_m are consistent with some
state sigma > 0, then they are also consistent with a state sigma{\textquoteright} of the form
sigma{\textquoteright} = (1/Z) exp(M_1+...+M_m), where each M_i is a Hermitian matrix acting on
the same qubits as rho_i, and Z is a normalizing factor. (This is known as a
Gibbs state.) Actually, we show a more general result, on the consistency of a
set of expectation values <T_1>,...,<T_r>, where the observables T_1,...,T_r
need not commute. This result was previously proved by Jaynes (1957) in the
context of the maximum-entropy principle; here we provide a somewhat different
proof, using properties of the partition function.

recently in one-dimensional Bose-Einstein atomic condensates in optical
lattices. We show that time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)
calculations can describe qualitatively the main features of the damping
observed over a range of lattice depths. We also derive a formula of the
fluctuation-dissipation type for the damping, based on a picture in which the
coherent motion of the condensate atoms is disrupted as they try to flow
through the random local potential created by the irregular motion of
noncondensate atoms. We expect this irregular motion to result from the
well-known dynamical instability exhibited by the mean-field theory for these
systems. When parameters for the characteristic strength and correlation times
of the fluctuations, obtained from the HFB calculations, are substituted in the
damping formula, we find very good agreement with the experimentally-observed
damping, as long as the lattice is shallow enough for the fraction of atoms in
the Mott insulator phase to be negligible. We also include, for completeness,
the results of other calculations based on the Gutzwiller ansatz, which appear
to work better for the deeper lattices.

	abstract = {  Robust quantum computation with d-level quantum systems (qudits) poses two
requirements: fast, parallel quantum gates and high fidelity two-qudit gates.
We first describe how to implement parallel single qudit operations. It is by
now well known that any single-qudit unitary can be decomposed into a sequence
of Givens rotations on two-dimensional subspaces of the qudit state space.
Using a coupling graph to represent physically allowed couplings between pairs
of qudit states, we then show that the logical depth of the parallel gate
sequence is equal to the height of an associated tree. The implementation of a
given unitary can then optimize the tradeoff between gate time and resources
used. These ideas are illustrated for qudits encoded in the ground hyperfine
states of the atomic alkalies $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs. Second, we provide a
protocol for implementing parallelized non-local two-qudit gates using the
assistance of entangled qubit pairs. Because the entangled qubits can be
prepared non-deterministically, this offers the possibility of high fidelity
two-qudit gates.

algorithm, and Deutsch{\textquoteright}s original XOR algorithm can all be formulated as
solutions to a hidden subgroup problem. Here the salient features of the
information-processing in the three algorithms are presented from a different
perspective, in terms of the way in which the algorithms exploit the
non-Boolean quantum logic represented by the projective geometry of Hilbert
space. From this quantum logical perspective, the XOR algorithm appears
directly as a special case of Simon{\textquoteright}s algorithm, and all three algorithms can
be seen as exploiting the non-Boolean logic represented by the subspace
structure of Hilbert space in a similar way. Essentially, a global property of
a function (such as a period, or a disjunctive property) is encoded as a
subspace in Hilbert space representing a quantum proposition, which can then be
efficiently distinguished from alternative propositions, corresponding to
alternative global properties, by a measurement (or sequence of measurements)
that identifies the target proposition as the proposition represented by the
subspace containing the final state produced by the algorithm.

algorithms factoring unitary evolutions of an n-qubit state space into
component two-particle unitary evolutions. In the absence of symmetry, Shende,
Markov and Bullock use Sard{\textquoteright}s theorem to prove that at least C 4^n two-qubit
unitary evolutions are required, while Vartiainen, Moettoenen, and Salomaa
(VMS) use the QR matrix factorization and Gray codes in an optimal order
construction involving two-particle evolutions. In this work, we note that
Sard{\textquoteright}s theorem demands C d^{2n} two-qudit unitary evolutions to construct a
generic (symmetry-less) n-qudit evolution. However, the VMS result applied to
virtual-qubits only recovers optimal order in the case that d is a power of
two. We further construct a QR decomposition for d-multi-level quantum logics,
proving a sharp asymptotic of Theta(d^{2n}) two-qudit gates and thus closing
the complexity question for all d-level systems (d finite.) Gray codes are not
required, and the optimal Theta(d^{2n}) asymptotic also applies to gate
libraries where two-qudit interactions are restricted by a choice of certain
architectures.

the system is deep in the Mott insulator regime, its response to the Bragg
perturbation is temperature dependent. We suggest that this dependence might be
used as a tool to probe temperatures of order of the Mott gap.

qudit is a d-dimensional system whose Hilbert space is spanned by states |0>,

describes how to exactly simulate an arbitrary unitary on multiple qudits using
a 2d-1 parameter family of single qudit and two qudit gates. Their technique is
based on the spectral decomposition of unitaries. Here we generalize this
argument to show that exact universality follows given a discrete set of single
qudit Hamiltonians and one two-qudit Hamiltonian. The technique is related to
the QR-matrix decomposition of numerical linear algebra. We consider a generic
physical system in which the single qudit Hamiltonians are a small collection
of H_{jk}^x=\hbar\Omega (|k><j|+|j><k|) and H_{jk}^y =\hbar\Omega
(i|k><j|-i|j><k|). A coupling graph results taking nodes 0,... d-1 and edges
j<->k iff H_{jk}^{x,y} are allowed Hamiltonians. One qudit exact universality
follows iff this graph is connected, and complete universality results if the
two-qudit Hamiltonian H=-\hbar\Omega |d-1,d-1><d-1,d-1| is also allowed. We
discuss implementation in the eight dimensional ground electronic states of
^{87}Rb and construct an optimal gate sequence using Raman laser pulses.

Our analysis is specifically aimed at understanding the quantum dynamics of solid-state quantum bits such as electron spins in semiconductor structures and superconducting islands. The role of mesoscopic degrees of freedom with long correlation times (local degrees of freedom such as nuclear spins and charge traps) in qubit-related dephasing is discussed in terms of a quasi-static bath. A mathemat- ical framework simultaneously describing coupling to the slow mesoscopic bath and a Markovian environment is developed and the dephasing and decoherence properties of the total system are investigated. The model is applied to several specific examples with direct relevance to current ex- periments. Comparisons to experiments suggests that such quasi-static degrees of freedom play an important role in current qubit implementations. Several methods of mitigating the bath-induced error are considered.

In this method, we use single photon emitters with two internal degrees of freedom formed by an electron spin and a nuclear spin to build intermediate nodes in a quantum channel. State-selective fluorescence is used for probabilistic entanglement generation between electron spins in adjacent nodes. We analyze in detail several approaches which are applicable to realistic, homogeneously broadened single photon emitters. Furthermore, the coupled electron and nuclear spins can be used to efficiently implement entanglement swapping and purification. We show that these techniques can be combined to generate high-fidelity entanglement over arbitrarily long distances. We present a specific protocol that functions in polynomial time and tolerates percent-level errors in entanglement fidelity and local operations.

good measurement on hidden subgroup states. For various groups that can be
expressed as the semidirect product of an abelian group and a cyclic group, we
show that the pretty good measurement is optimal and that its probability of
success and unitary implementation are closely related to an average-case
algebraic problem. By solving this problem, we find efficient quantum
algorithms for a number of nonabelian hidden subgroup problems, including some
for which no efficient algorithm was previously known: certain metacyclic
groups as well as all groups of the form (Z_p)^r X| Z_p for fixed r (including
the Heisenberg group, r=2). In particular, our results show that entangled
measurements across multiple copies of hidden subgroup states can be useful for
efficiently solving the nonabelian HSP.

	abstract = {  We consider the dihedral hidden subgroup problem as the problem of
distinguishing hidden subgroup states. We show that the optimal measurement for
solving this problem is the so-called pretty good measurement. We then prove
that the success probability of this measurement exhibits a sharp threshold as
a function of the density nu=k/log N, where k is the number of copies of the
hidden subgroup state and 2N is the order of the dihedral group. In particular,
for nu<1 the optimal measurement (and hence any measurement) identifies the
hidden subgroup with a probability that is exponentially small in log N, while
for nu>1 the optimal measurement identifies the hidden subgroup with a
probability of order unity. Thus the dihedral group provides an example of a
group G for which Omega(log|G|) hidden subgroup states are necessary to solve
the hidden subgroup problem. We also consider the optimal measurement for
determining a single bit of the answer, and show that it exhibits the same
threshold. Finally, we consider implementing the optimal measurement by a
quantum circuit, and thereby establish further connections between the dihedral
hidden subgroup problem and average case subset sum problems. In particular, we
show that an efficient quantum algorithm for a restricted version of the
optimal measurement would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the subset
sum problem, and conversely, that the ability to quantum sample from subset sum
solutions allows one to implement the optimal measurement.

Nevertheless, Aaronson and Ambainis showed that a database of N items laid out
in d spatial dimensions can be searched in time of order sqrt(N) for d>2, and
in time of order sqrt(N) poly(log N) for d=2. We consider an alternative search
algorithm based on a continuous time quantum walk on a graph. The case of the
complete graph gives the continuous time search algorithm of Farhi and Gutmann,
and other previously known results can be used to show that sqrt(N) speedup can
also be achieved on the hypercube. We show that full sqrt(N) speedup can be
achieved on a d-dimensional periodic lattice for d>4. In d=4, the quantum walk
search algorithm takes time of order sqrt(N) poly(log N), and in d<4, the
algorithm does not provide substantial speedup.

Clifton-Bub-Halvorson theorem characterizing quantum theory in terms of three

opposed to a theory about the mechanics of nonclassical waves or particles, (2)
given the information-theoretic constraints, any mechanical theory of quantum
phenomena that includes an account of the measuring instruments that reveal
these phenomena must be empirically equivalent to a quantum theory, and (3)
assuming the information-theoretic constraints are in fact satisfied in our
world, no mechanical theory of quantum phenomena that includes an account of
measurement interactions can be acceptable, and the appropriate aim of physics
at the fundamental level then becomes the representation and manipulation of

propose a framework for the generation of Markovian quantum dynamics and study
the resources needed for universality. For the case of a single qubit, we show
that a single nonunitary process is necessary and sufficient to generate all
unital Markovian quantum dynamics, whereas a set of processes parametrized by
one continuous parameter is needed in general. We also obtain preliminary
results for the unital case in higher dimensions.

	abstract = {  Quantum adiabatic evolution provides a general technique for the solution of
combinatorial search problems on quantum computers. We present the results of a
numerical study of a particular application of quantum adiabatic evolution, the
problem of finding the largest clique in a random graph. An n-vertex random
graph has each edge included with probability 1/2, and a clique is a completely
connected subgraph. There is no known classical algorithm that finds the
largest clique in a random graph with high probability and runs in a time
polynomial in n. For the small graphs we are able to investigate (n <= 18), the
quantum algorithm appears to require only a quadratic run time.

The resulting theory, deemed KCC-theory, is a rich geometric study which in many ways generalizes Riemannian and Finsler geometry. Yet, in many applications one requires a metric structure in addition to the systems of second order differential equations. We pose a geometry which is equipped with both of these structures, and solve the problem of local equivalence and thus determining a preferred connection and finding a generating set for all the invariants of the theory.},

	abstract = {  Unconditionally secure two-party bit commitment based solely on the
principles of quantum mechanics (without exploiting special relativistic
signalling constraints, or principles of general relativity or thermodynamics)
has been shown to be impossible, but the claim is repeatedly challenged. The
quantum bit commitment theorem is reviewed here and the central conceptual
point, that an {\textquoteleft}Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen{\textquoteright} attack or cheating strategy can always
be applied, is clarified. The question of whether following such a cheating
strategy can ever be disadvantageous to the cheater is considered and answered
in the negative. There is, indeed, no loophole in the theorem.

of quantum limits on measurement sensitivity. A measurement of a weak force
acting on a quantum system is a determination of a classical parameter
appearing in the master equation that governs the evolution of the system;
limitations on measurement accuracy arise because it is not possible to
distinguish perfectly among the different possible values of this parameter.
Tools developed in the study of quantum information and computation can be
exploited to improve the precision of physics experiments; examples include
superdense coding, fast database search, and the quantum Fourier transform.

auxiliary internal level to perform logic between ions, this resource is not
necessary in principle. Instead, one may perform such operations directly using
sideband laser pulses, operating with an arbitrary (sufficiently small)
Lamb-Dicke parameter. We explore the potential of this technique, showing how
to perform logical operations between the internal state of an ion and the
collective motional state and giving explicit constructions for a
controlled-not gate between ions.

spaces associated to a Galilean-type group. Certain Cartan connections on a
manifold with values in the Lie algebra of the Galilean group are characterized
as geometries associated to systems of second order ordinary differential
equations. We show these Cartan connections admit a form of normal coordinates,
and that in these normal coordinates the geodesic equations of the connection
are second order ordinary differential equations. We then classify such
connections by some of their torsions, extending a classical theorem of Chern
involving the geometry associated to a system of second order differential
equations.
